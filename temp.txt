- listening well is a superpower. while listening to someone you love, keep asking them, is there more, until there is no more
- prototype your life. try stuff instead of making grand plans
- a worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you cant believe how ignorant you were a year earlier
- treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. it's powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends 
- experience is overrated. most breakthrough accomplishments were done by people doing them for the first time. therefore when hiring, hire for aptitude and attitude and then train for skills
- that thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult - if you dont lose it 
- to build strong children, reinforce their sense of belonging to a family by articulating exactly what is distinctive about your family. they should be able to say with pride, our family does x
- dont reserve your kindest praise for a person until their eulogy. tell them while they are alive, when it makes a difference to them, write it in a letter they can keep
- a good question to ask yourself today is, what might i be wrong about? this is the only worry worth having
- the foundation of maturity: just because it's not your fault doesnt mean it's not your responsibility
- most overnight successes - in fact, any significant successes - take at least 5 years. budget your life accordingly
- everyone's time is finite and shrinking. the highest leverage you can get with your money is to buy someone else's time. hire and outsource when you can 
- you will complete your mission in life when you figure out what your mission in life is. your purpose is to discover your purpose. this is not a paradox. this is the way.
- writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever 
- to transcend the influence of your heroes, copy them shamelessly like a student until you get them out of your system. this is the way of all masters 
- greatness is incompatible with optimising in the short term. to achieve greatness requires a long view. raise your time horizon to raise your goal
- the consistency of your endeavours (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally
- efficiency is highly overrated, goofing off is highly underrated. regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks, and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. the best work ethic requires a good rest ethic 
- ask anyone you admire: their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. so embrace detours. life is not a straight line for anyone 
- getting cheated occasionally is the small price for trusting the best of everyone, because when you trust the best in others, they generally treat you best 
- you cant change your past, but you can change your story about it. what is important is not what happened to you but what you did about what happened to you 
- the big dirty secret is that everyone, especially the famous, are just making it up as they go along 
- your 20s are the perfect time to do a few things that are unusual, weird, bold, risky, unexplainable, crazy, unprofitable, and look nothing like success. for the rest of your life these experiences will serve as your muse
- commit to doing no work, no business, no income one day a week. call it a sabbath (or not). use that day for resting, recharging, and cultivating the most important things in life. counterintuitively, this sabbath will prove to be your most productive act all week 
- embrace pronoia, which is the opposite of paranoia. choose to believe that the entire universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success
