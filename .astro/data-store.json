That turned into learning how to draw, to better appreciate art history. With the recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) trend, I wanted to share what I learnt about art today, and then discuss NFTs in a follow up post [^1].\n\n## 1. What is pure art?\n\nI've been primarily using [smarthistory](https://smarthistory.org/ 'smart') to learn art history, though the video that kick started my journey was [this MoMa one on how to paint like Picasso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGZYfSzvPvs&list=PLfYVzk0sNiGEZXlIltPP7Yy_s5gTM7hf8 'moma').\n\nI've also touched on art history before with articles on [Picasso](https://leonlins.com/writing/2020_04_08_picasso/ 'picasso') and [Manet](https://leonlins.com/writing/2020_12_09_art/ 'manet') if you want to check those out.\n\n**The most important thing I learnt about art history is to be open-minded.**\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nSuppose someone were to come to you and say, \"I'm sick of the fake art of today, I want to see real, pure art.\"\n\nWhat would you show them?\n\nPerhaps you would show them [The School of Athens,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens 'school') a painting by Raphael during the height of the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s. With its realistic portrayal of famous philosophers and use of [linear perspective](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)> 'perspective') to make things look 3D, the famous fresco is seen as a masterpiece epitomising the Renaissance.\n\n![post](./a_1.webp)\n\nOr perhaps you'd reject historical subjects, thinking that art shouldn't need to have a moral lesson attached. Instead, you show a 1800s painting by Dominique Ingres that's pure pleasure and fantasy, claiming that real art doesn't have to be realistic. [La Grand Odalisque looks realistic on first glance, but taking a closer look shows that the spine is weirdly long, and the back leg is attached at a weird angle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Odalisque 'wiki')\n\n![post](./a_2.webp)\n\nYou might say that pleasure is superficial, and it's purer to commemorate modern suffering, such as in Goya's 1800s [The Third of May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808 'may'). It's less realistic than the works earlier, with the figures being flatter and less finished. It's also no longer make-believe, since it depicts an actual tragedy during Goya's time [^2]. It was such a departure from previous tradition it's been called \"one of the first paintings of the modern era.\"\n\n![post](./a_3.webp)\n\nBut why limit painting to showing just one snapshot in time? What if instead you saw an object from all sorts of angles, and tried to put that down onto the flat canvas? Think Matrix bullet time, but as a painting; wouldn't that be more true to the object? Showing a cubist piece like Picasso's 1900s [Girl with a Mandolin](https://www.pablopicasso.org/girl-with-mandolin.jsp 'girl') would be a good choice then, with its attempt at showing a 3D someone from multiple points of views on a 2D surface.\n\n![post](./a_4.webp)\n\nAnd you could say all of the above is pretentious, and that art is just colours and lines on canvas. Showing a 1900s Mondrian makes the point that we shouldn't deceive ourselves with realism. Pure art is platonic shapes [^3].\n\n![post](./a_5.webp)\n\nI could go on; there's as many art movements as there are cryptocurrencies. The main point I want to make though is that art is subjective, and keeping an open mind is essential. Discussing whether something is art or not is one of those unanswerable philosophical questions.\n\nMany new movements were criticised during their time, only to become inspiration for generations of artists after [^4]. For many artists, pushing the boundary is the point.\n\nIt's ok to not like something - I still don't get most contemporary art. But to dismiss something just because you don't like it will limit your understanding of the world. And that's no fun.\n\n## 2. Being flexible in art\n\nI also started learning to draw last year for a couple of reasons:\n\n- As part of my neverending quest to stop getting stereotyped [^5]\n- To better appreciate how artists were creating their work, and distinguish between skill and bullshit\n- I was thinking about skills that I could work on for a long time, and ones I could continue into old age\n- Add to my toolbox of ways to communicate and express myself\n\nI started with [draw a box](https://drawabox.com/ 'draw'), and then moved on to [New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/ 'nma'), which I'm still using [^6]. I mainly work with pencil and fountain pen [^7].\n\nAs a sidenote, if [aphantasia is real](https://leonlins.com/writing/2019_07_31_aphantasia/ 'abp'), I probably have it, seeing as I'm a 3-4 on the below test. It hasn't been a hurdle when drawing from reference, though it might be one when drawing from imagination.\n\n![post](./a_6.webp)\n\nRoughly a year of daily practice and 600 pieces of paper later [^8], here's a progress pic. And yes, they're meant to be the same person:\n\n![post](./a_7.webp)\n\nAnd here's what I've learnt along the way:\n\n**Drawing is a skill,** and talent is overrated. I have no talent, as can be seen in that first pic. But regular practice will deliver results, and you can slowly get better over time. Talent helps, but it's not the only factor.\n\n**You're drawing, not copying.** The drawing will stand alone after you're done, since people won't see the reference. You can and should make any changes you want for a more interesting piece. It's made me less interested in hyper realistic pieces; why not just take a photograph [^9].\n\n**You learn tools, not rules.** The lessons teach you ways of doing things, but not the only way of doing things.\n\n**Small things make a big difference.** Drawing in pencil is distinct from drawing in pen (try it!). Small markings on a portrait can change how the entire drawing feels.\n\n**Rushing ruins the work.** Every time I tried to rush through a piece, it turned out bad. The better pieces I've done were all patiently built up in layers, though taking a long time doesn't guarantee quality. And it usually requires multiple sketches before producing a good piece.\n\nAs intimidating as it was, I'm glad I picked up drawing. I may not ever be an expert, but it's a lot of fun [^10]! And we could all use more fun things to learn.\n\n## Other\n\n1.

Much of our lives are decided by algorithms. Knowing what algorithms to follow can result in more efficient and effective decision making.\n\n## Algorithms in life\n\nI recently re-read [Algorithms to Live By](https://algorithmstoliveby.com/ 'algo'), a book by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths on how algorithms can help us be more effective in our lives. Having picked up programming last year, I got more out of this time around.\n\nAn algorithm is a process, and you can think of it as instructions to follow to complete some task. For example, learning how to add numbers together is a simple algorithm [^1].\n\nMore complex instructions can calculate results for other problems in life. Interest rates, web search rankings, or social media feeds are all based on the output of algorithms. The book goes through many such algorithms, and relates them to problems you might face personally.\n\nIt's too difficult to explain every algorithm they mention [^2], so instead I'll be doing short highlights from some, and usually concentrating on the qualitative, not quantitative takeaways.\n\nAlso, most of the algorithms rely on certain assumptions; rather than specify that every time, take that as a given when reading. I'll add some of the assumptions in footnotes for those interested.\n\nSome of the problems discussed include:\n\n- When to stop interviewing for the max chance of the best outcome\n- When you should stop exploring new options to enjoy the ones you already know\n- How to schedule your tasks based on what your goal is\n\nLet's look at our first algorithm, on when you should stop working on a problem.\n\n## Optimal stopping\n\nIf you're evaluating options (job applicants, housing offers, parking spaces etc), there's a tradeoff between how long you spend choosing, and the chance of picking the \"best\" option. This is known as the [secretary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem 'prob') - suppose you were hiring a secretary, how many interviews should you do to get the best chance of finding the best one?\n\nIn this case, there's a precise percentage to use. You should wait after seeing 37% of the applicant pool, and then take the next best applicant you see [^3]. For example, if you had 100 applicants, wait after you've seen the first 37, and then pick the next applicant that is better than all you've seen so far.\n\nThat is the mathematically optimal point with the highest chance of picking the best person for the job. If you stop too early, you might miss someone interviewing later. If you stop too late, you waste time [^4].\n\n![post](./a_1.webp)\n\n## Explore exploit\n\nSimilar to the optimal stopping situation, there's a tradeoff between information gathering (explore) and enjoying (exploit). Suppose you're at a casino, and want to decide which machines to play. You want to maximise your winnings, but don't know the exact odds for the machines (if you did, you'd play the best one).\n\nIn this case, there's a number, known as the [Gittins Index](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2017sp/lecnotes/6840sp17R_Kleinberg.pdf 'gittins'), that gives you the optimal machine to play [^5]. If you know the number of wins, losses, and how much you value future gains, you can calculate precise values for each choice. Some interesting properties:\n\n- If you're playing the optimal machine and win again, it makes sense to continue playing that machine\n- If you're playing the optimal machine and lose once, it might still make sense to continue playing that machine\n- An entirely unknown machine can be preferable to machines that are known to win often, and that unknown machine gets more valuable the more you value future gains\n\nSome other related implications:\n\n- Exploration has a higher impact younger in life; babies putting everything in their mouth makes sense from their standpoint\n- Exploiting has a higher impact later in life; hence older people cutting down their social network and preferring to return to favourite restaurants\n\n## Sorting\n\nThe book gave a few examples of sorting algorithms, which are commonly used in programming. For example, returning search results requires a sorting of the most relevant ones for you.\n\nI'll save more detailed discussion of sorting algos for another day since they require understanding [time complexity](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/ 'time'). Here are some qualitative takeaways:\n\n- Some ways of sorting can be drastically more efficient than others (>10x faster)\n- Some scenarios do not desire sort efficiency only. For example, arranging a sports season matchup calendar also requires taking into account how exciting the season will be. You could optimise sort efficiency, but the season will seem less thrilling\n- The more efficient a sort, the more fragile it might be against accidental mistakes. For example, the \"best\" team might accidentally get knocked out in a single elimination tournament (essentially a sorting algo) like the World Cup [^6].\n\n## Caching and memory\n\nThe idea of having a cache is to have 1) a small, fast memory (storage) section, and 2) a large, slow memory section. We'll then alternate between the two depending on what our intention is. This lets us get both some amount of speed and some amount of size for the activity we want.\n\nFor example, you might have your favourite clothes in your wardrobe, and your unused ones in the attic. You'd have quick access to the items you used the most, but still have space for that ugly christmas sweater if you wanted. Caching sounds complicated, but you'll realised we do it naturally for most of our daily lives.\n\nHow do you decide what items should be put in the fast section, and what items in the slow section? You could put random items, the newest item, the largest item etc.\n\nIn this case, keeping the most recently used items in the small and fast section is the optimal choice, due to something known as [temporal locality](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-spatial-locality-and-temporal-locality/ 'temp'). You're more likely to need something again that's something you've recently used. For example, google drive highlights your frequently used files for quick access.\n\n![post](./a_2.webp)\n\n## Scheduling\n\nMost of us have to decide how to prioritise items on our to do list. This usually requires making a tradeoff between responsiveness (how quickly you respond) and throughput (how much you can get done).\n\nA key point about scheduling and prioritisation is defining your goal metric, since that determines what algorithm you want to use [^7]. Maximising responsiveness comes at the expense of how much you can get done:\n\nIf you want to minimise the max lateness of all your projects [^8], the [Earliest Due Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-machine_scheduling 'EDT') algorithm tells you to start with the project due earliest.\n\nIf you want to minimise the total completion time, the [Shortest Processing Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-machine_scheduling 'spt') algorithm tells you to just do the quickest task first.\n\nIf your tasks are not equal in importance, then placing a weight on each task and calculating the weight over time required ratio will help you decide which task to do; pick the project with highest weight over time.\n\nPractically, this means that it's probably worth having a conversation with your manager on how the team thinks about this tradeoff, and which method they'd prefer you adopt.\n\nThere's another important concept in scheduling, which is the idea of [context switching](https://blog.doist.com/context-switching/ 'switch') - whenever you have to switch between tasks. Context switching is wasted time since it's not real work, but takes up time and effort on your part.\n\nFor example, if you were writing an email and then got interrupted by a slack message, it takes time for you to both respond to the slack message, and then remember what you wanted to do for the email.\n\nAt its worst, context switching turns to thrash, when you get nothing productive done because you're too busy with only switching. Ways to avoid thrash include:\n\n- Saying no to tasks, though the authors acknowledge we're often unable to do so\n- Working dumber and more inefficiently. Rather than think about the optimal way to get through your tasks, just start on something and get it done\n\n## Bayes rule and distributions\n\nExplaining Bayes rule would probably take an article on its own, so let's just take it as a rule that helps you with predicting how likely something is to occur [^9]. What the authors want to highlight is that this depends on the distribution that your events are coming from. There are three main distributions to think about:\n\n- Power law: the longer something has gone on, the longer we expect it to continue going on. For example, if a company has been growing a long time, we'd expect it to continue growing\n- Normal: early events are surprising, late events are expected. For example, we'd be surprised by people who die early in life, and not by people who die late in life.\n- Erlang: events are never any more or less surprising. For example, a memoryless distribution of a roulette wheel or [the coin flips we discussed last week](https://leonlins.com/writing/2021_04_03_ergodicity/ 'sub')\n\n![post](./a_3.webp)\n\n## Game theory\n\nMost of us have probably heard of game theory before, which is a way of thinking what the optimal strategy is when playing a game. Some highlights:\n\n- If you play too many levels above your opponent, you're going to think they have information they don't actually have, and they won't be able to think what you want them to think. Put another way, you don't want to get _too_ smart with your strategies\n- Every two player game has at least one [Nash Equilibrium,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium 'nash') where both players are choosing the optimal strategy for themselves\n- However, finding Nash equilibrium is an intractable problem, meaning there's limits to the practicality of game theory\n- The equilibrium may also not be the outcome that is best for all players. [It may be optimal for an individual to compete, but optimal for the group to cooperate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,working%20at%20RAND%20in%201950. 'wiki') We can quantify this as the \"price of anarchy\", which measures the gap between cooperation and competition.\n- There's also a counterintuitive concept known as [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design 'mech'), which shows that _worsening_ every outcome might actually make everyone better off, due to shifting the equilibrium\n\nBesides the algorithms mentioned above, the authors also go through:\n\n- When you might be overfitting your decision making process and what you can do about it\n- What to do when real world problems aren't as nice as theory and why you should relax constraints\n- How to think about information networking and how the internet works\n\nOverall I thought the book was worth reading to get an overview of interesting ways algorithms show up in life. I did understand it better _after_ learning some computer science though, so keep that in mind. I also wish that they'd included more practical examples [^10], since trying to apply the findings to life can be difficult when you have to work off different assumptions.\n\n[^1]: Easy enough to teach children, by telling them to memorise sums and when to carry a number, but surprisingly not obvious when trying to implement on a computer, see [full adder logic gate](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html 'full')\n\n[^2]: You might say that by the time I explain everything, I might as well have [written the entire book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem 'p np')\n\n[^3]: [The percentage is 1 divided by e, euler's number.](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-4/issue-3/Who-Solved-the-Secretary-Problem/10.1214/ss/1177012493.full 'problem') The chance doesn't change as the size of the applicant pool grows, but does change with different information states you get\n\n[^4]: The base secretary problem assumes that you can't go back to a candidate that you passed on, but there are variations that resemble real life a bit more closely.\n\n[^5]: This problem is intractable if the probabilities of a payoff on a machine change over time; essentially meaning it's unsolvable. Some problems are intractable. In these cases, relaxing some constraints and accepting solutions that are \"close enough\" helps us significantly in structuring the problem.\n\n[^6]: Or March Madness, for the Americans\n\n[^7]: Only 9% of all scheduling problems can be solved efficiently.\n\n[^8]: As in, take all your projects that are late, and then the maximum of those. That's the metric you want to minimise.\n\n[^9]: See [here](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/ 'bayes') for an article that explains Bayes. Bayes is unintuitive (for me at least), which also means its good to know\n\n[^10]: To be fair, there's a good amount of information in the footnotes elaborating more","src/content/blog/2021_04_10_algo/index.md",[24,25,26],"8a032e645107429d",{"html":72,"metadata":73},"\u003Ch2 id=\"takeaway\">Takeaway\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>An algorithm is a defined process to follow to get a desired result.
