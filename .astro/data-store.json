It has been lightly edited for clarity and web reading.\n\n# Introduction\n\nInterest in no and low alcohol wines (NOLO) has never been higher. This \u003C11% alcohol by volume (ABV) category [^1] just hit a new peak in worldwide Google searches (Google, 2023); it is also the trending topic at major wine exhibitions (Carter, 2023).\n\n[^1]: For a comprehensive definition of NOLO as used in this paper, refer to Appendix 1\n\n![Chart](./image3.webp)\n*Figure: Google Trends interest in no and low alcohol wine.*\n\nWith worldwide NOLO sales predicted to grow twice as fast as the overall\nwine market, and this rapid growth expected across major wine consuming\ncountries, the race is on to secure first-mover advantage in a category\nstill in the introduction stage of its product life cycle (Fact.MR,\n2022; Statista, 2023). High volume producers (e.g. Yellow Tail) and low\nvolume wineries (e.g. Barton Guestier) alike are experimenting with NOLO\nas a new revenue stream (Frank, 2022).\n\n![Chart](./image19.webp)\n*Figure: Projected NOLO market growth relative to the overall wine market.*\n\nThe paper is structured around three questions:\n\n1. Why NOLO is growing fast, from a demand and supply perspective\n2. How NOLO is made, with resulting tradeoffs in quality and price\n3. Where NOLO can go, and my contrarian opinion on NOLO marketing\n\n# From YOLO to NOLO\n\nNOLO's growth can be attributed to (1) Decreased alcohol consumption due\nto social and political factors, impacting *demand* (2) Improved NOLO\nproduct quality driven by economic and technological factors,\ninfluencing *supply*. The increased demand for NOLO attracts new supply,\nin a reinforcing growth loop that has excited both consumers and\nproducers.\n\n## Factors impacting alcohol demand\n\nAlcohol consumption has declined in recent decades, particularly among\nthe younger generation (Loy et al., 2021). This shift has led some\nconsumers to substitute traditional alcoholic wines with NOLO\nalternatives, as outlined in a World Health Organization (WHO) report\n(World Health Organization, 2023). For example, \"Dry January\" started as\na discussion about having a temporary break from drinking [^2] (Alcohol\nChange UK, 2023).\n\n[^2]: Dry January is a month where people pledge to not drink alcohol; it is the highest month of NOLO sales (Drizly, 2023)\n\nResearch indicates that the decline in alcohol consumption has been a\nglobal phenomenon for the past 50 years, and not country specific [^3]\n(Our World in Data, 2017).\n\n[^3]: The UK was an exception for this time period, but also sees a decline when a longer period is chosen\n\n![Chart](./image14.webp)\n*Figure: Long-run decline in alcohol consumption across countries.*\n\nA 2022 study of Nordic and Mediterranean countries also showed mostly\ndeclines in the proportion of adolescent drinkers (Rossow et al., 2022).\n\n![Chart](./image29.webp)\n*Figure: Adolescent drinking declines in Nordic and Mediterranean countries.*\n\nA more extensive study in 2015 concurred, revealing a gradual decline in\nalcohol use among both European and North American youth (Looze et al.,\n2015).\n\n![Chart](./image26.webp)\n*Figure: Youth alcohol use declines in Europe and North America.*\n\n**Health is the main reason for this decline**. In a turnaround from the\n\"You Only Live Once (YOLO)\" mentality of the past[^4], people today are\nincreasingly health conscious. Consumers are still worried about not\nfully experiencing life, but are also concerned that their health might\nprevent them from doing so, and changing what they consume as a result\n(Texas Health, 2023). Across generations, people are increasing their\nprioritisation of health (The New Consumer & Coefficient Capital, 2022).\n\n[^4]: YOLO was re-popularised in the 2010s due to a song, with loose origins to the phrase “carpe diem”\n\n![Chart](./image25.webp)\n*Figure: Surveyed shifts toward health prioritization.*\n\nFor example, ~35% of American consumers surveyed adopted new eating\npatterns to \"prevent future health conditions\" (International Food\nInformation Council Foundation, 2018). The 2020 COVID pandemic also put\na spotlight on this social norm, with consumers being more observant of\ntheir health as a result (NutriSystem, 2023).\n\nBeyond the social aspect, politics have played a role in shaping\nattitudes toward alcohol, by increasing awareness of its adverse health\neffects. With the World Cancer Research Fund finding strong evidence\nthat alcohol consumption increases cancer risk[^5], and the WHO\nestimating harmful alcohol usage represents 5% of the global disease\nburden[^6], governing bodies such as the EU are considering stronger\nalcohol regulations (World Cancer Research Fund, 2018; World Health\nOrganization, 2022).\n\n[^5]: Mouth, oesophagus, breast cancer were some cancers specifically mentioned in the report\n[^6]: As measured in disability adjusted life years\n\nThese regulations are typically aimed at restricting and reducing\nalcohol consumption (Looze et al., 2015; Goold et al., 2017). The\nstronger the national alcohol policy, the lower the alcohol consumption\nin that country (Brand et al., 2007). For example, over a period of 50\nyears Norwegians have reversed their attitude and become increasingly\nsupportive of alcohol control policies, due to increased awareness of\nalcohol health risks (Rossow & Storvoll, 2013).\n\nBecause of these social and political factors, consumers are\nreconsidering their relationship with wine, believing that reducing\nalcohol consumption will decrease calorie intake, blood pressure, and\ncancer risk (World Health Organization, 2023). Additionally, for women,\nconsiderations related to pregnancy and nursing have driven them to\nexplore NOLO, as noted by Dawn Maire, founder of a NOLO startup (Reiley\net al., 2023).\n\nFor example, a 2017 study found that \"health\" was the main reason\nparticipants decreased their wine consumption[^7] (Stockley et al.,\n2017).\n\n[^7]: The chart shows the combined response totals across multiple participant experiment groups \n\n![Chart](./image10.webp)\n*Figure: Health as a primary reason for reduced wine consumption.*\n\nThese health-conscious consumers are choosing NOLO as a substitute for\ntraditional wine. A 2014 UK study found that the top reason for lower\nalcohol purchases was \"it's better for my health\" (Bruwer et al., 2014).\n\n![Chart](./image24.webp)\n*Figure: UK motivations for lower-alcohol purchases.*\n\nA separate 2013 Australian study supported this, with \"health\" being\nthe second most common motivation for interest in NOLO (Saliba et al.,\n2013).\n\n![Chart](./image22.webp)\n*Figure: Australian motivations for NOLO interest.*\n\n## Factors impacting NOLO supply\n\nHowever, these demand influences on NOLO would not have been fulfilled,\nhad product quality missed expectations. After all, NOLO is trending,\nnot grape juice. Economic and technological factors have increased the\nsupply of quality product offerings, past a tipping point of consumer\nacceptance.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, NOLO's high growth provides an attractive\nnew profit opportunity, with industry experts discussing how \"there's\nmoney to be made\" for producers (Carter, 2023). Companies that\neffectively target the younger demographic through enticing social\nmedia, graphics, and packaging have experienced notable success (Beaton,\n2022). For example, Boisson, a NOLO retailer, increased its revenue 300%\nfrom 2021 to 2022, and recently raised venture funding from Pernod\nRicard[^8] (Business Wire, 2023).\n\nFrom a technology perspective, NOLO quality has improved greatly over\nthe past 30 years. Historically, sweetness was used to compensate for\nthe lack of ethanol, with sugar levels >40 g/L being common[^9] (Schulz\net al., 2023). However, the typical drinker associates sweetness with\nlower quality cheap wine[^10], resulting in NOLO also being perceived as\nlow quality even before being tasted (Josselin et al., 2008).\n\n[^8]: Boisson raised a $5mm bridge round from Convivialité Ventures, the venture arm of Pernod Ricard, and Connect Ventures (Business Wire, 2023) \n[^9]: Typical dry wines have \u003C2 g/L of sugar\n[^10]: A pity, as the author personally loves dessert wines\n\n![Chart](./image1.webp)\n*Figure: Sweetness perceptions and quality associations in NOLO.*\n\nModern technology has changed this. Lower processing temperatures and\nenhanced aroma adjustments have elevated product standards (Bucher et\nal., 2020; Pickering, 2010). While we will discuss the production\nprocess in detail in the next section, one such technique is the use of\nlinalool, geranial, and isoamyl acetate extracts to enrich floral and\nfruity aromas in NOLO, where regulations are less strict than\ntraditional wine[^11] (Ma et al., 2022).\n\nToday, NOLO wines are getting good reviews. For example, Wine\nSpectator's review of Ariel Vineyards NOLO Chardonnay described it as\n\"balanced, with varietal-specific aromas and flavors\" (Napjus, 2022). A\nrecent 2020 experiment also found no significant difference in how much\nparticipants liked NOLO vs standard wine[^12] (Bucher et al., 2020).\n\n[^11]: Linalool contributes floral, geranial rose, and isoamyl acetate banana aromas respectively \n[^12]: In the “blind” condition, participants did not know they were drinking NOLO, vs the “low-alcohol wine” condition where they did know \n\n![Chart](./image28.webp)\n*Figure: Comparative liking of NOLO vs standard wine.*\n\n**In summary, health has been the main demand driver for NOLO, with\nprofit opportunities and technology improvements the main supply\ndrivers**. Although there are secondary reasons such as the\naffordability of lower taxed NOLO vs higher taxed traditional wine,\nsocial influencer campaigns, or a 2018 change in US tax law on higher\nalcohol wine driving alcohol driving alcohol reduction companies to seek\nnew customers, the country agnostic growth in NOLO is due to the primary\nreasons above.\n\n# Reduce and reuse to make NOLO\n\nThis section outlines the main post-fermentation techniques used to reduce alcohol, emphasizing how process choices affect style, quality, and cost.\n\nUnlike \"natural wine\", NOLO requires massive human meddling. Instead of\n\"nothing added, nothing taken\", NOLO opts for a \"reduce and reuse\"\napproach. Extreme opposites in winemaking philosophies; yet both have\nachieved success.\n\nWhether red, white, rose, or sparkling, NOLO is typically made via two\nprimary method families, each with subcategories:\n\n1. Thermal distillation\n   1. Vacuum distillation\n   2. Spinning cone column\n2. Semi-permeable membrane\n   1. Reverse osmosis\n   2. Osmotic distillation\n\n## Thermal distillation approaches\n\nThermal distillation processes require higher temperatures and cost more\nthan membrane processes. Within this method, vacuum distillation is a\ncommon technique already used to adjust traditional wine alcohol levels\nat many wineries (Motta et al., 2017). Inside a tank, wine is heated at\nmoderate temperatures (15-20C) under vacuum, which evaporates the\nethanol. The ethanol vapour rises to the top of the tank, condensing as\na distillate in a separate container, *reducing* the ABV of the tank's\nliquid. Producers might opt to *reuse* volatile aromas from the\ndistillate by capturing and adding them back after distillation (Ma et\nal., 2022).\n\n![](./image35.webp)\n*Figure: Vacuum distillation process schematic.*\n\nVacuum distillation has a mixed effect on NOLO style and quality. It can\nsignificantly reduce many desirable volatile compounds, such as esters,\nhigher alcohols, and terpenes. However, it can concentrate sugars and\ncolour intensity (Sam et al., 2021). It is also quicker to reach a low\nfinal level of ABV.\n\n![Chart](./image6.webp)\n*Figure: Vacuum distillation outcomes and tradeoffs.*\n\nSpinning cone column (SCC) is a modification of the vacuum distillation\nprocess that takes place in two stages to improve aroma retention. SCC\nconsists of a central vertical shaft with convex cones[^13], rotating\nbetween other convex cones attached to the interior casing of the tank\n(Schmidtke et al., 2012). In the first stage, low vacuum pressure and\nmoderate ~28C temperatures are used to recover desirable volatile\naromas. In the second stage, higher vacuum pressure and ~38C\ntemperatures are used to remove alcohol (Sam et al., 2021). The aromas\nfrom the first stage are *reused* by combining with the *reduced*\nalcohol liquid from the second stage, to create a product stylistically\nmore similar to regular wine, and of higher quality than vacuum\ndistillation.\n\nIn SCC, wine is pumped to the top of the tank, onto the 1st rotating\ncone attached to the central shaft. The spinning results in centrifugal\nforce spraying a thin film of wine outwards onto the 1st fixed cone\nattached to the tank[^14]. The liquid trickles down this 1st fixed cone\nonto the 2nd rotating cone, and the process is repeated until it reaches\nthe bottom of the column. While this is happening, a \"stripping\ngas\"[^15] is pumped in the bottom of the tank. As the gas rises to the\ntop, it picks up volatile aromas or ethanol through mass transfer. Fins\nattached to the cones increase turbulence and hence effectiveness of the\nprocess. This allows for both a *reduction* in alcohol, and a *reuse* of\naromas later on (Schmidtke et al., 2012).\n\n[^13]: Point of the cone facing downwards\n[^14]: Note that SCC is not a centrifuge; it spins at lower forces (Beverage Trade Network, 2023)\n[^15]: Such as nitrogen\n\n![](./image36.webp)\n*Figure: Spinning cone column process schematic.*\n\nSCC stands out for its ability to recover desirable aromas with both\nhigh efficiency and minimal passes, leading to higher quality NOLO.\nWhile it is favoured by producers for its quality outcomes, the downside\nincludes the substantial capital costs for equipment and the requirement\nfor specialised operational expertise, implying higher production\nvolumes are required to make it economical.\n\nFor example, BevZero, an alcohol reduction provider, quotes \\$1-2mm\nsetup costs for SCC (Beverage Trade Network, 2023). Producers may\noutsource this step to providers such as BevZero, similar to how some\nsparkling winemakers delegate parts of the production process (BevZero,\n2023; Oztruk & Anli, 2015). However, this may not be possible in\ncountries where expected production volumes are too low to justify\ninvestment, such as Austria (Gentile et al., 2023).\n\n## Membrane-based approaches\n\nMembrane processes typically require lower temperatures but more passes\nthan thermal processes. Reverse osmosis (RO) uses a hydrophilic\nsemi-permeable membrane under high pressure but low 1-5C temperatures.\nHigh pressure on the side with a higher concentration solution causes a\nreverse of the typical osmosis process, resulting in even higher\nconcentrations on that side. This filters out smaller ethanol and water\nmolecules from the base wine over multiple tangential passes through the\nmembrane. The ethanol and water mixture can be further separated through\ndistillation, allowing for *reuse* of the water in the process (Ma et\nal., 2022).\n\n![](./image37.webp)\n*Figure: Reverse osmosis process schematic.*\n\nRO benefits include aroma retention due to the low operating\ntemperatures, lower capital and operating costs than thermal\ndistillation (therefore possibly lower prices), and being a \"clean\"\ntechnology since the ethanol and water can be reused after extraction.\nFor example, it has a lower rate of higher alcohol and terpene loss\ncompared to vacuum distillation, implying a higher quality NOLO that is\nstylistically more similar to regular wine (Sam et al., 2021).\n\nRO drawbacks include the multiple passes required for the alcohol\nreduction, recurring costs for membrane replacement, and legal\nuncertainties regarding the re-addition of water in the production\nprocess, since adding water to wine is banned in some countries (Ma et\nal., 2022).\n\n![Chart](./image17.webp)\n*Figure: Reverse osmosis impacts on style and aroma retention.*\n\nOsmotic distillation[^16] (OD) also uses a membrane for alcohol\nreduction. Differential vapour pressure on both sides of a hydrophobic\nmembrane causes ethanol to evaporate on one side, diffuse across the\nmembrane, and then condense on the other side with the help of a\n\"stripping gas\"[^17] (Schmidtke et al., 2012).\n\n[^16]: Also known as as evaporative pertraction (Ma et al., 2022)\n[^17]: Typically degassed pure water vapour (Schmidtke et al., 2012) \n\n![](./image38.webp)\n*Figure: Osmotic distillation process schematic.*\n\nCompared to RO, OD requires lower pressures and temperatures. However,\nlonger processing time is required. OD effect on style and quality is\nuncertain, with conflicting studies citing minimal aroma compound loss\nor adverse effects on volatile aromas, depending on the amount of\nalcohol reduced (Ma et al., 2022; Schmidtke et al., 2012).\n\nOther post fermentation options in NOLO production include\nnanofiltration, pervaporation, or multistage systems that combine\nmultiple methods. However, these are not as widely used commercially due\nto cost or lack of research, and we will not be discussing these further\n(Ma et al., 2022; Schmidtke et al., 2012).\n\n## Comparative summary of NOLO production methods\n\n| **Removal method** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Sample producers** |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|----------------------|\n| **Vacuum distillation** | • Good for sugar and colour concentration\u003Cbr>• Cheap; many wineries already have the equipment\u003Cbr>• Lower price implication | • Bad for style and quality due to reduction of esters, higher alcohols, terpenes | • Weingut Leitz\u003Cbr>• Thomson & Scott\u003Cbr>• St Regis |\n| **Spinning cone column** | • Good for style and quality due to high aroma recovery\u003Cbr>• Faster processing time as fewer passes required | • High \\$1–2 mm capital costs\u003Cbr>• Specialised expertise required\u003Cbr>• Higher price implication | • Giesen\u003Cbr>• Fre Wines\u003Cbr>• Weingut Leitz |\n| **Reverse osmosis** | • Good for style and quality due to aroma retention\u003Cbr>• Lower capital and operating costs than thermal distillation\u003Cbr>• Lower price implication\u003Cbr>• “Clean” technology | • Legal uncertainty where water cannot be added to wine (grape must may be a workaround)\u003Cbr>• Slower processing time due to multiple passes\u003Cbr>• Recurring membrane replacement costs | • Ariel Vineyards |\n| **Osmotic distillation** | • Potentially good for style and quality due to aroma retention\u003Cbr>• Energy and cost savings from lower temperature and pressure | • Even slower processing time than RO due to lower temperature and pressure | • None disclosed publicly |\n\n\n(Alexandra, 2021; LeBeau, 2018; Mowery, 2021; VE Refinery, 2022)\n\n# NOLO has ample room to grow\n\nNOLO's current total market revenue of \\$2bn is a fraction of the total\n\\$173bn wine market, implying future growth potential (Fact.MR, 2022;\nStatista, 2023). Though there are some headwinds ahead, the tailwinds\nfor this category should continue to propel faster growth than the\noverall wine market. In addition, I would like to propose an alternative\napproach to NOLO marketing.\n\n## Headwinds to NOLO growth\n\nClimate change, costs of production, and consumer perception are the\nthree main headwinds to NOLO growth.\n\nClimate change typically results in higher alcohol levels in wine, the\nreverse of NOLO aims. Sunny winemaking regions have seen alcohol content\nrise by ~2% ABV over the past 30 years due to the higher sugar\nconcentration at harvest (Goold et al., 2017).\n\nThe increased production costs associated with crafting NOLO from\nquality base wine suggest the need for higher pricing. However, it\nremains uncertain whether consumers are willing to pay *more* for a\nproduct with *less* alcohol. A 2020 study indicated reduced consumer\nwillingness to pay for NOLO, supported by a NielsenIQ report revealing\nan average US NOLO price of \\$6.84 vs \\$11.01 for traditional wine\n(Bucher et al., 2020; NielsenIQ, 2023). In contrast, six of the top\neight best-selling NOLO products on Boisson are priced >\\$20, above the\ntypical cost of traditional wines[^18] (Boisson, 2023).\n\n[^18]: See Appendix 2 for a list of Boisson (a NOLO retailer) best selling products and prices\n\n![Chart](./image2.webp)\n*Figure: NOLO pricing relative to traditional wine benchmarks.*\n\nConsumer perception that NOLO products are inferior is also an obstacle.\nAcceptance of NOLO varies by country, with people adjusting their\nattitudes only when assured that taste quality would be the same (Saliba\net al., 2013).\n\n![Chart](./image21.webp)\n*Figure: NOLO acceptance varies when quality parity is emphasized.*\n\n## Mitigation options\n\nProducers have multiple options to mitigate the above risks. In the\nvineyard, planting varieties that naturally make lower alcohol wines\n(e.g. Furmint), harvesting earlier, or selecting sites of formerly\nmarginal areas benefiting from climate change (e.g. UK) could increase\nNOLO production resilience (Frank, 2022).\n\nIn the winery, usage of glucose oxidase to reduce fermentable sugars or\nnew yeast strains selected for lower ethanol production[^19] could\nreduce costs in the future. For instance, Athletic Brewing Co has\nsuccessfully prevented ethanol generation during fermentation for its\nbeers (Mazzeo, 2022). This remains a field of ongoing research due to\nthe complexity of yeast biology in quality wine production (Goold et\nal., 2017; Schmidtke et al., 2012).\n\nTo change consumer perception, producers might consider partnering with\nthe public sector for additional marketing impact. Governments or public\nhealth agencies could be open to promoting NOLO, if it helps reduce\noverall alcohol consumption and improve health outcomes. Having\nadditional funding from other sources will help NOLO reach a larger top\nof the funnel audience. For example, the UK Department of Health and\nSocial Care is committed to supporting the NOLO industry to increase\nproduct availability by 2025 (Gov.UK, 2023).\n\nSince NOLO is not subject to the same restrictions as wine, alternative\nsales channels can also help with growth. For example, US regulations\ntechnically consider the ethanol content destroyed after the NOLO\nprocess, placing it under Food and Drug Administration rather than\nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau jurisdiction. This makes it\npossible to sell and offer tastings of NOLO in grocery stores, an\nattractive marketing opportunity (Beverage Trade Network, 2023).\n\n[^19]: For example, Pichia Pastoris, Williopsis Saturnus, or genetically engineered Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Schmidtke et al., 2012)\n\nNOLO technology is likely to improve over time; health conscious\nattitudes towards alcohol are unlikely to reverse in the short term.\nTogether with the options above, it is likely NOLO continues growing\nfaster than the traditional wine market.\n\n## Changing the branding positioning of NOLO\n\n**I also believe that current NOLO marketing is missing the point**.\nRather than harping on the association with wine, NOLO should\nintentionally brand itself as a standalone category. Consumers do not\ncare that the product was originally made from wine or about the\ntechnological breakthroughs behind it. Instead, they want something that\ntastes good and makes them feel good about their lifestyle choices.\n\nHere, NOLO can learn from sparkling and natural wine. Both fall under\nthe broader category of wine but are regarded as distinct products.\nConsumers don't object to the effervescence in their Champagne or the\nhaziness in their natural wine; these characteristics are embraced\nwithin their respective styles. Similarly, NOLO should offer a distinct\nstyle rather than mimic wine. Transforming into a beverage that people\nenjoy on its own will also alleviate the current challenges associated\nwith pairing NOLO with food.\n\nEspecially noteworthy is the potential rise of a sparkling NOLO product\npromoted based on its inherent qualities, akin to the recent surge in\nthe hard seltzer market (Grand View Research, 2023). The effervescence\ncan enhance the perception of quality, mask potential faults, and\ndistinguish it from traditional wine. Given positive reviews for\nsparkling NOLO products (e.g. Thomson & Scott Noughty), it's not\nsurprising that the majority of current NOLO offerings are of the\nsparkling variety (Farrell, 2023; Gentile et al., 2023).\n\n![Chart](./image18.webp)\n*Figure: Sparkling NOLO prominence within current offerings.*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA hundred years on from Prohibition, the Temperance movement has come\nand gone, but perhaps a tempered temperance, NOLO movement is on the\nrise. Health concerns have increased demand for NOLO, with technological\nand economic factors improving supply.\n\nAs these trends mutually reinforce each other in a growth loop, I\nanticipate sustained and even accelerated growth in the NOLO category.\nFurthermore, I foresee the ascent of a sparkling NOLO product solely\ndriven by its exceptional taste, breaking free from the limitations of\nbeing solely a wine derivative, and evolving to a formidable standalone\nbrand.\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">Bibliography\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\nAlcohol Change UK.

A\n0.7% ABV wine may be classified as \"low alcohol\" in the UK, but\n\"non-alcoholic\" in China, due to varying regulations (Anderson et al.,\n2021; Sam et al., 2021)\n\nIn this paper we will adopt the International Organisation of Vine and\nWine (OIV) thresholds of \u003C0.5% ABV for no alcohol wine (OIV, 2012).\n\nWe will adopt >=0.5% ABV for low alcohol wine, up to the typical ABV of\nthat wine style (typically ~11% ABV at a minimum, though this varies by\nwine style) in cases where the alcohol reduction is >20% (OIV, 2012).\n\nWe will only include wine where alcohol has been reduced\npost-fermentation to be intentionally marketed as NOLO. Therefore, we\nare excluding wines such as sweet Riesling, Moscato d'Asti, or\nCalifornia wines with reduced alcohol for tax reasons (BevZero, 2023).\n\nWe are also excluding non alcoholic products that have never been\nthrough the fermentation process, such as grape juice or herbal\ninfusions.\n\nAn interesting side note is that reducing alcohol for tax reasons was a\nprimary driver of business for alcohol reduction service providers such\nas BevZero, who had to diversify their income stream after a change in\nUS tax law on higher alcohol wines resulted in less demand for alcohol\nreduction services.\n\n\u003C/details>\n\u003Cbr>\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">Appendix 2\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\n### Best selling products on Boisson are priced higher than traditional wine\n\nThis appendix summarizes pricing context for NOLO products on Boisson\n\n(Boisson, 2023)\n\n![](./image15.webp)\n*Figure: Boisson best-selling NOLO products and pricing.*\n\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/blog/2024_01_31_dipwset_thesis/index.md",[26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46],"./image3.webp","./image19.webp","./image14.webp","./image29.webp","./image26.webp","./image25.webp","./image10.webp","./image24.webp","./image22.webp","./image1.webp","./image28.webp","./image35.webp","./image6.webp","./image36.webp","./image37.webp","./image17.webp","./image38.webp","./image2.webp","./image21.webp","./image18.webp","./image15.webp","b4323187d928f70f",{"html":49,"metadata":50},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Editorial Note\u003C/strong>: This essay was originally written as part of a professional wine examination.

Though there are some headwinds ahead, the tailwinds\nfor this category should continue to propel faster growth than the\noverall wine market. In addition, I would like to propose an alternative\napproach to NOLO marketing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"headwinds-to-nolo-growth\">Headwinds to NOLO growth\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Climate change, costs of production, and consumer perception are the\nthree main headwinds to NOLO growth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Climate change typically results in higher alcohol levels in wine, the\nreverse of NOLO aims. Sunny winemaking regions have seen alcohol content\nrise by ~2% ABV over the past 30 years due to the higher sugar\nconcentration at harvest (Goold et al., 2017).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The increased production costs associated with crafting NOLO from\nquality base wine suggest the need for higher pricing. However, it\nremains uncertain whether consumers are willing to pay \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> for a\nproduct with \u003Cem>less\u003C/em> alcohol. A 2020 study indicated reduced consumer\nwillingness to pay for NOLO, supported by a NielsenIQ report revealing\nan average US NOLO price of $6.84 vs $11.01 for traditional wine\n(Bucher et al., 2020; NielsenIQ, 2023). In contrast, six of the top\neight best-selling NOLO products on Boisson are priced >$20, above the\ntypical cost of traditional wines\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-18\" id=\"user-content-fnref-18\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">18\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> (Boisson, 2023).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image2.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cem>Figure: NOLO pricing relative to traditional wine benchmarks.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Consumer perception that NOLO products are inferior is also an obstacle.\nAcceptance of NOLO varies by country, with people adjusting their\nattitudes only when assured that taste quality would be the same (Saliba\net al., 2013).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image21.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cem>Figure: NOLO acceptance varies when quality parity is emphasized.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"mitigation-options\">Mitigation options\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Producers have multiple options to mitigate the above risks. In the\nvineyard, planting varieties that naturally make lower alcohol wines\n(e.g. Furmint), harvesting earlier, or selecting sites of formerly\nmarginal areas benefiting from climate change (e.g. UK) could increase\nNOLO production resilience (Frank, 2022).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the winery, usage of glucose oxidase to reduce fermentable sugars or\nnew yeast strains selected for lower ethanol production\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-19\" id=\"user-content-fnref-19\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">19\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> could\nreduce costs in the future. For instance, Athletic Brewing Co has\nsuccessfully prevented ethanol generation during fermentation for its\nbeers (Mazzeo, 2022). This remains a field of ongoing research due to\nthe complexity of yeast biology in quality wine production (Goold et\nal., 2017; Schmidtke et al., 2012).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To change consumer perception, producers might consider partnering with\nthe public sector for additional marketing impact. Governments or public\nhealth agencies could be open to promoting NOLO, if it helps reduce\noverall alcohol consumption and improve health outcomes. Having\nadditional funding from other sources will help NOLO reach a larger top\nof the funnel audience. For example, the UK Department of Health and\nSocial Care is committed to supporting the NOLO industry to increase\nproduct availability by 2025 (Gov.UK, 2023).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since NOLO is not subject to the same restrictions as wine, alternative\nsales channels can also help with growth. For example, US regulations\ntechnically consider the ethanol content destroyed after the NOLO\nprocess, placing it under Food and Drug Administration rather than\nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau jurisdiction. This makes it\npossible to sell and offer tastings of NOLO in grocery stores, an\nattractive marketing opportunity (Beverage Trade Network, 2023).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>NOLO technology is likely to improve over time; health conscious\nattitudes towards alcohol are unlikely to reverse in the short term.\nTogether with the options above, it is likely NOLO continues growing\nfaster than the traditional wine market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"changing-the-branding-positioning-of-nolo\">Changing the branding positioning of NOLO\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>I also believe that current NOLO marketing is missing the point\u003C/strong>.\nRather than harping on the association with wine, NOLO should\nintentionally brand itself as a standalone category. Consumers do not\ncare that the product was originally made from wine or about the\ntechnological breakthroughs behind it. Instead, they want something that\ntastes good and makes them feel good about their lifestyle choices.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here, NOLO can learn from sparkling and natural wine. Both fall under\nthe broader category of wine but are regarded as distinct products.\nConsumers don’t object to the effervescence in their Champagne or the\nhaziness in their natural wine; these characteristics are embraced\nwithin their respective styles. Similarly, NOLO should offer a distinct\nstyle rather than mimic wine. Transforming into a beverage that people\nenjoy on its own will also alleviate the current challenges associated\nwith pairing NOLO with food.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Especially noteworthy is the potential rise of a sparkling NOLO product\npromoted based on its inherent qualities, akin to the recent surge in\nthe hard seltzer market (Grand View Research, 2023). The effervescence\ncan enhance the perception of quality, mask potential faults, and\ndistinguish it from traditional wine. Given positive reviews for\nsparkling NOLO products (e.g. Thomson &#x26; Scott Noughty), it’s not\nsurprising that the majority of current NOLO offerings are of the\nsparkling variety (Farrell, 2023; Gentile et al., 2023).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image18.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n\u003Cem>Figure: Sparkling NOLO prominence within current offerings.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>A hundred years on from Prohibition, the Temperance movement has come\nand gone, but perhaps a tempered temperance, NOLO movement is on the\nrise. Health concerns have increased demand for NOLO, with technological\nand economic factors improving supply.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As these trends mutually reinforce each other in a growth loop, I\nanticipate sustained and even accelerated growth in the NOLO category.\nFurthermore, I foresee the ascent of a sparkling NOLO product solely\ndriven by its exceptional taste, breaking free from the limitations of\nbeing solely a wine derivative, and evolving to a formidable standalone\nbrand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">Bibliography\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cp>Alcohol Change UK.

Amontillado and Oloroso seem to be hit or miss for me. I suspect this is partially a budgetary issue, given the lack of selection available at reasonable prices in ths US.\n\n> Chaucer (13402-1400) was the son of a vintner and was famously accurate in everything he mentioned, so it appears that wines from southern Spain were already fortified when he wrote his Tales, and this is borne out by the knowledge that the Moors distilled alcohol and used it for medicinal purposes. \n\n> One of the captains from Jerez, Fernando de Trejo, was moved to write in 1498, 'Toast the wine of the most noble and loyal Jerez, for it is a joy to the spirits, light to the eyes - a gift of God.'\n\n> [As of the 1700s] most of the sherry trade was centred in Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María, less in Jerez. This followed from the unpredictable movement of shipping in those days: the boats sailed at the first favourable wind, and the wine had to be waiting at the port. The shipping bodegas of the principal houses, where mature wine was stored ready for export, were built in the coastal towns and they remained there until the middle of the nineteenth century when the railway made transport quick and easy, and steam power made shipping independent of winds. \n\n> Worst of all, merchants were forbidden to accumulate large stocks; wine was therefore not matured long enough, and trade was lost because lack of stock caused delay in preparing the blends for shipment. The idea behind this extraordinary regulation was that such wine stores would divert profits from the hands of the growers into those of merchants, and that it would encourage speculation\n\n> The sherry slump at the turn of the [20th] century was brought about by five factors working together: the dreadful imitation sherries or 'horrible mixings' from Hamburg and other places; the very inferior wines made in Jerez itself during the boom years; the ignorant attacks of certain doctors who claimed that the wine was 'plastered', 'gouty', 'full of added spirit', and 'acid to the stomach'; the caprice of fashion; and, lastly, the plague of the phylloxera which for several years made wine growing difficult, unprofitable and heartbreaking\n\nSherry has generally declined significantly in popularity in recent decades, much like other fortified wines, such as Port or Madeira.\n\n> The trade of an almacenista in those days was an important one. Many shippers, even some of the largest like Williams & Humbert, preferred to limit their stocks of wine and to own no vineyards, relying on the plentiful supplies available from the almacenistas\n\n> Perhaps the greatest change of all is the rise of the boutique bodegas.This was made possible by a change in the regulations. To get a shipping licence a bodega had to hold stocks of 12,500 hectolitres, and this was reduced to 500. The almacenistas had been having a bad time, as falling demand meant that their customers, the big shippers, had enough wine of their own and decided to be self-reliant, so their market was lost. Many had wines of great age and quality. The new regulations enabled them to become shippers and small bodegas could be started up.\n\n> very occasionally there is a calamity, but the trials and tribulations of the Jerez wine growers are nothing compared to those of almost any other growing area. \n\n> A new vineyard is by no means ready to produce good wine. Any wine made in the first year is used for distillation, that of the second and third years for making mistela sweetening wines, that of the fourth year (a small crop) for cheap sherries, and then serious production begins in the fifth year.\n\nThis applies not just to sherry, but generally for most grape vines.\n\n> For this purpose it is essential to use good oak. Other woods, such as chestnut and cherry, have been tried, but without success\n\n> In the scales of a solera, where the old wine is drawn off at regular intervals and replaced with younger, the flor breeds indefinitely, and when a butt has been in position in a solera for fifty or sixty years there is a considerable accumulation of dead cells in the lees.\n\n> There is an infinite number of possible variants that may affect the wine's growth and development.

It has been lightly edited for clarity and web reading.\n\n# Introduction\n\nCava has a bright, some might even say sparkling, future as we look towards future growth trends, as long as it is willing to adopt some unconventional ideas while still holding on to its rich tradition and history.\n\nIn this paper I will discuss:\n\n1.  Wine and Cava specific growth rates, as context for how to project the future\n\n2.  Growth areas for Cava, based on current consumption data\n\n3.  Marketing ideas for Cava in consideration of the above\n\n# Wine and Cava specific growth rates\n\nUnderstanding the macroeconomic context of the global wine industry is essential for projecting Cava's trajectory. This section examines declining alcohol consumption patterns, the divergent performance of wine categories, and why sparkling wines—particularly Cava—present a compelling growth opportunity despite broader market headwinds.\n\n## Overall wine market decline\n\nBy now, it is no secret that the wine industry overall is facing difficulties. Alcohol consumption has declined in all major markets as part of a pattern 50 years in the making, and we should not expect a reversal in habits any time soon. Health, prices, habits have all changed, and the wine world is adapting to this new reality.\n\n![Chart showing overall wine consumption trends](./image1.webp)\n\n*Figure 1: Wine consumption trends across major markets, illustrating the 50-year decline in overall alcohol consumption.*\n\nHowever, this decline in growth is not affecting the wine world evenly. Still wines have suffered the most, but sparkling wines have either had smaller declines, or even growth in some years.\n\n![Chart showing sparkling versus still wine growth](./image11.webp)\n\n*Figure 2: Comparative growth trends for sparkling and still wine categories, highlighting the outperformance of sparkling wines.*\n\n## Sparkling wine outlook and category divergence\n\nThe outlook for sparkling wines is also better than for still wines. According to IWSR, among the 3 major categories of still, sparkling, and fortified wine, the sparkling category is expected to have +1% cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2027, unlike still wine which is expected to further decline with a -1% CAGR. It is a much better time to be a sparkling wine producer compared to a still wine producer, all other things being equal.\n\nThis divergence in outlooks becomes even clearer once we segment the data by country. Countries such as Portugal, Argentina, Canada have had >20% growth rates in volume of sparkling wine in 2024. Clearly, concluding that all of the wine world in all countries is declining is too generic of a statement, and misses the subtleties of consumer demand in some areas.\n\nHuge opportunities in wine sales still exist, but understanding the market and consumer has become even more relevant in this fragmented age. There are still pockets of growth, but we must be more intentional in targeting these subsets. We should keep this in mind as we think about Cava's future internationally.\n\n![Chart showing regional sparkling wine growth](./image5.webp)\n\n*Figure 3: Regional sparkling wine growth rates by country, demonstrating significant variation in market performance.*\n\nGiven the volume growth projections, there is clearly still demand globally for sparkling wine, even more so in particular countries. It is now the moment for Cava to seize this opportunity to expand its customer base, and build the top of funnel marketing base for future growth. Doing so now, while being able to take advantage of the momentum of sparkling wine overall, will make the campaign much easier compared to attempting to reverse a decline, should that happen in the future. This is why it is essential for Cava to lay the groundwork now, to reap the benefits of brand recognition a few years down the line.\n\n## Cava's performance relative to competing sparkling wines\n\nLooking closer at sparkling wine data split by major types, we see that Prosecco has been the main driver of volume growth in the past few years. This is in contrast to Cava, Champagne, Franciacorta growth being mostly flat.\n\nIn situations like these with diverging growth rates, we should:\n\n1.  Accept reality, and acknowledge the difference in sales volumes\n\n2.  Identify what Prosecco has been doing to continue growing\n\n3.  Assess what Cava would want to adopt, and what not to adopt, given its own culture\n\n4.  Get buy in from all stakeholders on how to develop Cava further\n\n5.  Set aside a long enough timeframe to implement the changes required\n\n![Chart showing sparkling wine category performance](./image7.webp)\n\n*Figure 4: Comparative performance of major sparkling wine categories (Prosecco, Cava, Champagne, Franciacorta), showing volume and growth divergence.*\n\n## Lessons from Prosecco's success\n\nProsecco has benefited from several key advantages that have driven its market ascendancy:\n\n1.  Inexpensive price point, particularly compared to Champagne\n\n2.  Easy to drink, light, fruity, refreshing profile\n\n3.  Rebranding of the region and Glera grape in 2009\n\n4.  Marketing, publicity, and association with the Italian lifestyle\n\nCava can learn from the above, but with its own flavour:\n\n1.  While inexpensive and premium Cava will always still play an important role, there is likely a price point just above that of\n    Prosecco, that is still affordable enough for the regular consumer,\n    but also helping to signal higher quality. Emphasise the quality and\n    value for money, but not the price\n\n2.  The citrus notes, high acidity, light body are plus points in favour\n    of Cava, and should be leaned into more when promoting. The ability\n    to pair well with food is also another huge bonus that more people\n    need to be educated on; Cava promotional events and tastings should\n    be conducted with food by default. In the completely opposite\n    direction, longer lees aging times will help create products\n    appealing to the niche super premium consumer segment, which will\n    help with growth in value but not volume\n\n3.  Continuing with the current educational series (e.g. Cava Academy)\n    and building the community for that will pay off in the medium term,\n    as wine educators and bar managers will have Cava top of mind for\n    them. The Cava brand name should continue to be the focus, rather\n    than individual grapes - think about how many people know Prosecco\n    but how few know what grape it uses\n\n4.  Regional, hyperlocal, specific products and experiences are trendy\n    now. Cava should strongly emphasise the unique Spanish nature of the\n    wine and the major zones. The sub zones are also a step in the right\n    direction to increase the appeal for the premium price point\n    consumer\n\nCava should not aim to compete or price, or brand itself as affordable\nChampagne, as that marketing strategy just increases customer awareness\nof other competitors while lowering the quality perception of Cava.\n\nCava should also not change its traditional methods of grape growing and\nproduction, and in fact actually lean into these aspects even more, in a\nworld where everything is becoming commoditised and identical.\n\n# Growth areas for Cava\n\nPart of Cava's struggles the past 3 years have been due to the drought in Spain, leading to poor yields, scarce supply, and drop in sales volumes internationally. However, given that this is a temporary supply side issue rather than a demand side decline, we can expect a recovery in key markets, assuming the supply problems are resolved.\n\nIdentifying high-potential markets requires a systematic approach combining consumption data, tourism patterns, and cultural alignment. This section outlines methods for market selection and proposes priority markets for Cava's expansion strategy.\n\n## Market selection methodology\n\nThere are a few ways to identify key growth countries for Cava.\n\nFirstly, taking a look at the largest markets for sparkling wine sales,\nwe see the following top 5 areas, per Wine Australia:\n\n![Chart showing top 5 sparkling wine markets](./image6.webp)\n\nFrance, Italy, and Germany have the majority of their sparkling wine\nsales as a direct consequence of their own local production methods. For\nexample, France has 92% local sparkling wine, and Italy has 83% local.\nIn contrast, the United States and United Kingdom continue to be mainly\nimporters of sparkling wine, making them large markets.\n\nThis does not mean that the United States and United Kingdom are the\nonly possible markets for Cava. Instead, it means that the marketing\napproach for Cava should differ across these top 5 countries. In\ncountries with high local sparkling wine production, we can build\ncuriosity about Cava rather than present Cava as a foreign competitor.\nIn countries with high import percentages, we can emphasise the Spanish\nangle and history.\n\n## Growth markets identified by sparkling wine category performance\n\nSecondly, referring back to the graph of sparkling wine growth by country discussed earlier, we see these countries as bright spots for growth:\n\n1.  Portugal\n\n2.  Argentina\n\n3.  Canada\n\n4.  Chile\n\n5.  Italy\n\nBesides Italy, which was just mentioned above in the overall sparkling wine sales section, the rest of the markets are additions to the list of potential growth markets for Cava. Building the brand presence there now while the countries are still experiencing sales momentum will help accelerate growth efforts in the future.\n\nThe main idea should be to build awareness of Cava on both the inexpensive and premium price points, through Spanish cultural and food pairing themed events in those countries. We do not want to position ourselves as a cheap Champagne alternative or a Prosecco permutation, but want to constantly reinforce the Spanish heritage and history.\n\n## Cava and tourism: Leveraging Spain's visitor base\n\nThirdly, another way of identifying interesting countries for Cava is by taking a look at the top inbound tourism countries visiting Spain as a whole, and the Catalunya region in particular. It is likely that promoting the Spanish connection and heritage of Cava will be effective when selling into these countries, given the inherent interest of the consumer base.\n\n![Inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya by country](./image10.webp)\n\n*Figure 5: Top source countries for inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya, showing tourism flows that correlate with Cava promotional opportunities. Data sources: [ine.es](http://ines.es), [idescat.cat](http://idescat.cat)*\n\nBased on the above, some other countries not previously identified include the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland. Although most of these are naturally European countries due to the ease of tourism, note that Canada does appear in the top 10 list of tourist arrivals for the Catalunya region specifically.\n\nWine tourism for Cava is definitely a possibility, but growth efforts can take an even lighter touch than that. Working together with private\ntour agencies, public government boards, the Cava DO can make itself\nmore visible at major tourist locations and events, to continue building\nawareness of the Spanish sparkling wine. It should be a stretch goal for\nevery tourist leaving Spain to have had at least a taste of Cava while\nthey were there. Airport tastings, winery tours, restaurant partnerships\nare all ways that this can be made to happen.\n\n## Target markets for concentrated growth efforts\n\nWe now have a good list of target markets to start with. To narrow it down, here are 3 proposed markets for growth, and also 3 underrated markets that could be interesting.\n\n**Growth markets**: United Kingdom, Portugal, Argentina\n\n**Underrated markets**: Canada, Belgium, Japan\n\nNote that while Japan did not make the lists in the above cuts, it is added in here due to market knowledge of how the sparkling wine market is still growing there due to their culture and desire for premium drinks. Using it as a testing ground for marketing ideas can also help with land and expand efforts for the rest of the Asian market.\n\nThe market identification above is for focused outreach efforts, and is not meant to imply that other markets should be neglected. For example, it would be foolish to ignore the United States and not sell into it, given the size of the market there. However, we can likely get more return on marketing spend by making targeted campaigns for other relatively less competitive regions instead, and reinvest the revenue for more growth. The intent should be to build reinforcing growth loops that are self-funding.\n\n# Marketing ideas for Cava\n\nHaving identified promising markets and understood Cava's competitive positioning, we now turn to unconventional promotional strategies that maintain brand integrity while building awareness. The following ideas prioritize long-term brand development and differentiation over short-term volume gains, ensuring Cava is positioned as a distinct Spanish product rather than a Champagne or Prosecco alternative.\n\nThe ideas may be less tried and true, but we want to always ensure that we still maintain the consistency of Cava, and respect the traditional ways of grape growing and wine production. We do not compromise on quality, but we do experiment with new promotional ideas.\n\nThree ideas for marketing Cava are:\n\n1.  Canned Cava\n\n2.  No and low alcohol (NOLO) Cava\n\n3.  Personalised Cava bottle labels with the help of generative AI\n\n## Canned Cava formats\n\nCanned wine sales are a high growth product segment, with Future Market\nInsights estimating a 17% CAGR over the next decade. Contrasting this\nwith the decline in still wine sales overall, this represents a\ncompletely different paradigm, and Cava should capitalise on this trend.\n\n![Chart showing canned wine market growth](./image3.webp)\n\nCanned wine is becoming more popular due to convenience, ease of\ntransport, and smaller portion sizes. For a younger generation of\nconsumers that drinks less overall, it is easier to bring around smaller\ncans for drinks, rather than a bottle that they may not be able to\nfinish. Some people may perceive canned wine to be healthier as well,\ngiven that some canned wine is wine with soda water added, which\ndecreases the calories.\n\nSparkling wines are also a perfect pairing with the can format, due to\nthe effervescent connection with other sparkling drinks triggering a\nsense of familiarity with the wine drinker. Cava can make use of this\nconnection to offer quality wine in a trendy packaging format.\nNaturally, this would be more appropriate for the inexpensive, fruitier\nstyles of Cava.\n\nSurprisingly, all major markets are expected to have high growth for\ncanned wine, which means that this marketing approach should work for\nCava in all the suggested markets identified in the above growth areas\nsection.\n\n![Chart showing global canned wine market growth](./image2.webp)\n\n## Taking advantage of NOLO growth\n\nThe no and low alcohol (NOLO) market is also another bright spot for\nwine. Growth rates are double that of the overall wine market, and also\nexpected to be similar among major markets such as the US, Germany, and\nJapan. Health concerns, demographic changes, and improvements in product\nquality have resulted in this divergence of growth rates compared to\noverall wine.\n\n![Chart showing NOLO market growth trends](./image4.webp)\n\nAmong NOLO, sparkling wine has been the most attractive product category\nso far, due to the product quality being better received by consumers.\nUnder current technology, it is harder to re-integrate the flavours and\naromas removed during the de-alcoholisation process for red wines, which\nends up causing a decline in taste. The bubbles in NOLO sparkling wine\ncan help lift the flavours compared to NOLO still white wine, and make\nit more pleasant to drink. As a result, there are currently\nsignificantly more SKUs of NOLO sparkling wine than there are whites or\nreds. Cava is a natural fit for NOLO.\n\n![Chart showing NOLO sparkling wine category performance](./image8.webp)\n\nCava can take advantage of this to make NOLO versions as well, with some\neven in cans, that will appeal to the more health conscious consumer.\nThis would not be a novel idea. Vilarnau has already made two variants\nof Cava, a brut and a rose, that are without alcohol. As expected, the\ntasting profile of these variants are fresh and fruity, and the price is\ninexpensive. Cava should continue to push on this front while the trends\nare still in its favour, especially since it will take time for\nproducers to set up the production process for NOLO.\n\n![Vilarnau NOLO Cava product example](./image12.webp)\n\n## Hyper personalisation for Cava\n\nNow that we've had 2 ideas for inexpensive Cava, the remaining idea is\nfor the premium and super premium Cava segment. The Cava de Paraje\nCalificado would be the ideal product type for this, and possibly even\nthe extremely long lees aging that some producers are experimenting with\nas well. The intent is to focus on smaller production, higher quality,\nso that the AI labelling idea is easier to execute.\n\nAt this price point and quality level, consumers are expecting unique\nproducts. What better way to do so, than make the bottle labelling\nunique per individual order, a result of their own design?\n\nWith the help of generative AI tools, consumers will be able to design\ntheir own bottle label, subject to a minimum order amount. Their premium\nCava case will be one of a kind, sure to scratch the collector's itch\nthat many of the clients in this segment have. A simple but more\nexpensive option would be to use paid tools such as Google AI Studio's\nNano Banana, which created this image below in less than a minute.\nImagine the possibilities for the consumer here.\n\n![Generative AI example for custom Cava label design](./image13.webp)\n\nThe more complicated but cheaper option in the long run would be to use\ncustom tools such as ComfyUI below together with purchased CPU and GPU\nhardware, to do the image generation ourselves. In other words, the\nwineries would have to buy the computing equipment, and set up the\nbackend and frontend software tools for users to be able to easily enter\ntext for image generation.\n\nAlthough this would be harder to set up, it would be cheaper after\ninitial capital costs are depreciated, due to the lower recurring cost\nnature vs the subscription and API fees for the paid tool options. There\nwould be more control over the entire end to end process as well.\n\n![ComfyUI workflow interface for image generation](./image9.webp)\n\n*Source: ComfyUI*\n\nThe premium price point of the product for this idea is required, due to\nthe higher effort and costs involved in producing the unique bottlings.\nSince we are targeting the high net worth customer segment, the\nincremental cost from the customisation is unlikely to impact demand.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCava has much to look forward to in the next decade, despite the worrying trends overall for the wine market. There still remain many countries where sparkling wine and especially Spanish wine will be growth engines. Cava can further take advantage of canned wine, NOLO, and generative AI tools to appeal more to the modern consumer. It does not have to change its cultural history, but it does have to experiment with new marketing approaches to expect changes in growth for the future.\n\n---\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">References\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\nThe art of drinks.

According to IWSR, among the 3 major categories of still, sparkling, and fortified wine, the sparkling category is expected to have +1% cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2027, unlike still wine which is expected to further decline with a -1% CAGR. It is a much better time to be a sparkling wine producer compared to a still wine producer, all other things being equal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This divergence in outlooks becomes even clearer once we segment the data by country. Countries such as Portugal, Argentina, Canada have had >20% growth rates in volume of sparkling wine in 2024. Clearly, concluding that all of the wine world in all countries is declining is too generic of a statement, and misses the subtleties of consumer demand in some areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Huge opportunities in wine sales still exist, but understanding the market and consumer has become even more relevant in this fragmented age. There are still pockets of growth, but we must be more intentional in targeting these subsets.

It is now the moment for Cava to seize this opportunity to expand its customer base, and build the top of funnel marketing base for future growth. Doing so now, while being able to take advantage of the momentum of sparkling wine overall, will make the campaign much easier compared to attempting to reverse a decline, should that happen in the future.

The ability\nto pair well with food is also another huge bonus that more people\nneed to be educated on; Cava promotional events and tastings should\nbe conducted with food by default. In the completely opposite\ndirection, longer lees aging times will help create products\nappealing to the niche super premium consumer segment, which will\nhelp with growth in value but not volume\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Continuing with the current educational series (e.g. Cava Academy)\nand building the community for that will pay off in the medium term,\nas wine educators and bar managers will have Cava top of mind for\nthem.

However, given that this is a temporary supply side issue rather than a demand side decline, we can expect a recovery in key markets, assuming the supply problems are resolved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Identifying high-potential markets requires a systematic approach combining consumption data, tourism patterns, and cultural alignment. This section outlines methods for market selection and proposes priority markets for Cava’s expansion strategy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"market-selection-methodology\">Market selection methodology\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are a few ways to identify key growth countries for Cava.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, taking a look at the largest markets for sparkling wine sales,\nwe see the following top 5 areas, per Wine Australia:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image6.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing top 5 sparkling wine markets&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>France, Italy, and Germany have the majority of their sparkling wine\nsales as a direct consequence of their own local production methods. For\nexample, France has 92% local sparkling wine, and Italy has 83% local.\nIn contrast, the United States and United Kingdom continue to be mainly\nimporters of sparkling wine, making them large markets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This does not mean that the United States and United Kingdom are the\nonly possible markets for Cava. Instead, it means that the marketing\napproach for Cava should differ across these top 5 countries. In\ncountries with high local sparkling wine production, we can build\ncuriosity about Cava rather than present Cava as a foreign competitor.\nIn countries with high import percentages, we can emphasise the Spanish\nangle and history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"growth-markets-identified-by-sparkling-wine-category-performance\">Growth markets identified by sparkling wine category performance\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Secondly, referring back to the graph of sparkling wine growth by country discussed earlier, we see these countries as bright spots for growth:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Portugal\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Argentina\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Canada\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Chile\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Italy\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Besides Italy, which was just mentioned above in the overall sparkling wine sales section, the rest of the markets are additions to the list of potential growth markets for Cava. Building the brand presence there now while the countries are still experiencing sales momentum will help accelerate growth efforts in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main idea should be to build awareness of Cava on both the inexpensive and premium price points, through Spanish cultural and food pairing themed events in those countries. We do not want to position ourselves as a cheap Champagne alternative or a Prosecco permutation, but want to constantly reinforce the Spanish heritage and history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"cava-and-tourism-leveraging-spains-visitor-base\">Cava and tourism: Leveraging Spain’s visitor base\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Thirdly, another way of identifying interesting countries for Cava is by taking a look at the top inbound tourism countries visiting Spain as a whole, and the Catalunya region in particular. It is likely that promoting the Spanish connection and heritage of Cava will be effective when selling into these countries, given the inherent interest of the consumer base.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image10.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya by country&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Figure 5: Top source countries for inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya, showing tourism flows that correlate with Cava promotional opportunities.

Although most of these are naturally European countries due to the ease of tourism, note that Canada does appear in the top 10 list of tourist arrivals for the Catalunya region specifically.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wine tourism for Cava is definitely a possibility, but growth efforts can take an even lighter touch than that. Working together with private\ntour agencies, public government boards, the Cava DO can make itself\nmore visible at major tourist locations and events, to continue building\nawareness of the Spanish sparkling wine. It should be a stretch goal for\nevery tourist leaving Spain to have had at least a taste of Cava while\nthey were there. Airport tastings, winery tours, restaurant partnerships\nare all ways that this can be made to happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"target-markets-for-concentrated-growth-efforts\">Target markets for concentrated growth efforts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>We now have a good list of target markets to start with. To narrow it down, here are 3 proposed markets for growth, and also 3 underrated markets that could be interesting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Growth markets\u003C/strong>: United Kingdom, Portugal, Argentina\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Underrated markets\u003C/strong>: Canada, Belgium, Japan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Note that while Japan did not make the lists in the above cuts, it is added in here due to market knowledge of how the sparkling wine market is still growing there due to their culture and desire for premium drinks. Using it as a testing ground for marketing ideas can also help with land and expand efforts for the rest of the Asian market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The market identification above is for focused outreach efforts, and is not meant to imply that other markets should be neglected. For example, it would be foolish to ignore the United States and not sell into it, given the size of the market there. However, we can likely get more return on marketing spend by making targeted campaigns for other relatively less competitive regions instead, and reinvest the revenue for more growth. The intent should be to build reinforcing growth loops that are self-funding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"marketing-ideas-for-cava\">Marketing ideas for Cava\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Having identified promising markets and understood Cava’s competitive positioning, we now turn to unconventional promotional strategies that maintain brand integrity while building awareness. The following ideas prioritize long-term brand development and differentiation over short-term volume gains, ensuring Cava is positioned as a distinct Spanish product rather than a Champagne or Prosecco alternative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ideas may be less tried and true, but we want to always ensure that we still maintain the consistency of Cava, and respect the traditional ways of grape growing and wine production. We do not compromise on quality, but we do experiment with new promotional ideas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Three ideas for marketing Cava are:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Canned Cava\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>No and low alcohol (NOLO) Cava\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Personalised Cava bottle labels with the help of generative AI\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"canned-cava-formats\">Canned Cava formats\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Canned wine sales are a high growth product segment, with Future Market\nInsights estimating a 17% CAGR over the next decade. Contrasting this\nwith the decline in still wine sales overall, this represents a\ncompletely different paradigm, and Cava should capitalise on this trend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image3.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing canned wine market growth&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Canned wine is becoming more popular due to convenience, ease of\ntransport, and smaller portion sizes. For a younger generation of\nconsumers that drinks less overall, it is easier to bring around smaller\ncans for drinks, rather than a bottle that they may not be able to\nfinish. Some people may perceive canned wine to be healthier as well,\ngiven that some canned wine is wine with soda water added, which\ndecreases the calories.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sparkling wines are also a perfect pairing with the can format, due to\nthe effervescent connection with other sparkling drinks triggering a\nsense of familiarity with the wine drinker. Cava can make use of this\nconnection to offer quality wine in a trendy packaging format.\nNaturally, this would be more appropriate for the inexpensive, fruitier\nstyles of Cava.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Surprisingly, all major markets are expected to have high growth for\ncanned wine, which means that this marketing approach should work for\nCava in all the suggested markets identified in the above growth areas\nsection.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image2.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing global canned wine market growth&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"taking-advantage-of-nolo-growth\">Taking advantage of NOLO growth\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The no and low alcohol (NOLO) market is also another bright spot for\nwine. Growth rates are double that of the overall wine market, and also\nexpected to be similar among major markets such as the US, Germany, and\nJapan. Health concerns, demographic changes, and improvements in product\nquality have resulted in this divergence of growth rates compared to\noverall wine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image4.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing NOLO market growth trends&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among NOLO, sparkling wine has been the most attractive product category\nso far, due to the product quality being better received by consumers.\nUnder current technology, it is harder to re-integrate the flavours and\naromas removed during the de-alcoholisation process for red wines, which\nends up causing a decline in taste. The bubbles in NOLO sparkling wine\ncan help lift the flavours compared to NOLO still white wine, and make\nit more pleasant to drink. As a result, there are currently\nsignificantly more SKUs of NOLO sparkling wine than there are whites or\nreds. Cava is a natural fit for NOLO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image8.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing NOLO sparkling wine category performance&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cava can take advantage of this to make NOLO versions as well, with some\neven in cans, that will appeal to the more health conscious consumer.\nThis would not be a novel idea. Vilarnau has already made two variants\nof Cava, a brut and a rose, that are without alcohol. As expected, the\ntasting profile of these variants are fresh and fruity, and the price is\ninexpensive. Cava should continue to push on this front while the trends\nare still in its favour, especially since it will take time for\nproducers to set up the production process for NOLO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image12.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Vilarnau NOLO Cava product example&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hyper-personalisation-for-cava\">Hyper personalisation for Cava\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Now that we’ve had 2 ideas for inexpensive Cava, the remaining idea is\nfor the premium and super premium Cava segment. The Cava de Paraje\nCalificado would be the ideal product type for this, and possibly even\nthe extremely long lees aging that some producers are experimenting with\nas well. The intent is to focus on smaller production, higher quality,\nso that the AI labelling idea is easier to execute.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this price point and quality level, consumers are expecting unique\nproducts. What better way to do so, than make the bottle labelling\nunique per individual order, a result of their own design?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the help of generative AI tools, consumers will be able to design\ntheir own bottle label, subject to a minimum order amount. Their premium\nCava case will be one of a kind, sure to scratch the collector’s itch\nthat many of the clients in this segment have. A simple but more\nexpensive option would be to use paid tools such as Google AI Studio’s\nNano Banana, which created this image below in less than a minute.\nImagine the possibilities for the consumer here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image13.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Generative AI example for custom Cava label design&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The more complicated but cheaper option in the long run would be to use\ncustom tools such as ComfyUI below together with purchased CPU and GPU\nhardware, to do the image generation ourselves. In other words, the\nwineries would have to buy the computing equipment, and set up the\nbackend and frontend software tools for users to be able to easily enter\ntext for image generation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although this would be harder to set up, it would be cheaper after\ninitial capital costs are depreciated, due to the lower recurring cost\nnature vs the subscription and API fees for the paid tool options.

There still remain many countries where sparkling wine and especially Spanish wine will be growth engines. Cava can further take advantage of canned wine, NOLO, and generative AI tools to appeal more to the modern consumer. It does not have to change its cultural history, but it does have to experiment with new marketing approaches to expect changes in growth for the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">References\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cp>The art of drinks.

Cava",["Date","2026-02-05T00:00:00.000Z"],[166,167,21],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./img2.webp","# Introduction to Cava\n\nCava is Spain's largest sparkling wine, with 218mm bottles sold in 2024, also making it the world's third largest sparkling wine. It is made in the traditional method, with second fermentation in bottle, and typically sold with minimal dosage (sugar added) [^1].\n\n[^1]: Dosage refers to the sugar added in the liqueur d'expédition to top up sparkling wines after disgorgement. Cava is typically in the Brut Nature (\u003C3 g/l) to Brut (\u003C12 g/l) range\n\n![Chart showing category sales](./img6.webp)\n\nCava's regulatory body, the Denominación de Origen Cava (D.O. Cava), has pushed for higher quality standards in recent years. The [new classification system has four categories](https://www.cava.wine/en/categories-types/), which primarily differ by ageing time on lees:\n\n1. Guarda - 9 months minimum of lees contact\n2. Guarda Superior Reserva - 18 months minimum\n3. Guarda Superior Gran Reserva - 30 months minimum\n4. Guarda Superior Paraje Calificado - 36 months minimum, with many additional criteria. [Only 10 Cavas qualify for this as of time of writing](https://www.cava.wine/en/categories-types/cava-de-paraje-calificado/)\n\nAs can be seen in the above infographic from the [D.O. Global report](https://cavaacademy.com/en/medialib/pdf/global-report-2024), the Guarda category is the bulk of Cava sales, with the remaining 3 categories being ~10%. **Paraje Calificado is only 0.01%!**\n\nThe majority of Guarda Superior sales are within the domestic Spanish market.\n\nAn interesting note is that **producers of the Guarda Superior categories typically age their Cavas far longer than minimum standards,** and it is common to see upwards of five years of bottle ageing in products just released on the market.\n\n![Chart showing grape varieties](./img5.webp)\n\n**Cava uses three main grapes (Macabeo, Xarel·lo, Parellada)**, although six others are also used. As with other wines, the grapes used in the making of a wine determine its style, and also whether it is suitable for lees ageing and bottle ageing.\n\n# Cava educational courses\n\n![Cava courses](./img7.webp)\n\nAs part of the overall push for more brand awareness, the D.O. also created [Cava Academy](https://cavaacademy.com/en/home), which does online and in person certification courses. \n\nI was fortunate enough to be selected for the 2026 Feb edition of the Cava Educator Advanced course, after having already completed the Cava Educator and Cava Expert courses [^2]. This was an in person course held in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, which included lectures, winery visits, and a final exam. \n\n[^2]: Cava Educator is primarily online, includes a tasting and online exam. Cava Expert requires submission of a thesis.\n\nBelow are notes from day 1 of the course.\n\n# Introduction to Cava history and current trends\n\n![Cava DO intro session](./img1.webp)\n\nI'd arrived in Barcelona the night before, given the lack of direct flights that would have gotten me in on time for the morning pickup. After some confusion where I nearly joined the wrong bus group [^bus], I was on the right bus and headed to the D.O. office, which is about an hour out from Barcelona city.\n\n[^bus]: In my defense, I heard someone say \"DO\" while looking for a bus and thought they meant the Cava D.O. Not in my defense, the itinerary did show us where we should be meeting, including a picture of the stop\n\nJudith Manero of the D.O. opened the course by walking us through Cava's history, recent regulations, and current trends.\n\n## Cava history\n\nJosep Raventos started Cava production in 1872, and today Cava is the only appellation in Spain which is 100% specialised in traditional method sparkling wines [^sparkling].\n\n[^sparkling]: There are other sparkling wines, and traditional sparkling wines from Spain, such as Corpinnat or Classic Penedès. Long story for another day\n\n**Cava was presented as being a combination of 'landscape' and 'humanity'**, with the mineral, clay soils and mediterranean climate combining with the human factors of grape growing and winemaking to create a special sparkling drink.\n\nTwo thirds of the vineyards in Catalunya are focused on Cava production. This consists of 343 wineries, of which ~200 make Cava, with the rest making base wine [^3]. The majority of production is by Freixenet and Codorníu for volume at a low price point; there has been a push for recognition of the higher price points (and higher quality) categories in recent years.\n\n[^3]: Base wine being used as the initial wines for blending in Cava production. The winery would make base wine from grapes and then sell to a Cava producer\n\n## Push for higher quality Cava categories\n\nThe higher quality categories refer to the Guarda Superior category mentioned in the intro section above. These are intentionally branded separately to distinguish them from the lower price point Guarda category, and have more stringent requirements.\n\nFor example, Guarda Superior is now 100% organic after recent efforts by the D.O. and growers.\n\nJudith also made a special note of:\n\n1. the Paraje Calificado category within Guarda Superior\n2. the Integral Producer (Elaborador Integral) quality seal\n\n**Paraje Calificado is the highest tier of Cava quality**, with only 6 wineries qualifying for it at time of writing, for a total of 10 Cavas. A paraje is awarded for a vineyard area, similar to a Cru in France. Unlike a Cru, each paraje is owned by a single winery. \n\nWineries have to apply for the Paraje qualification with single vintage wines that have been on the market for at least five years, that come from areas distinguished by specific terroir characteristics. The tasting panel for this category is also different from the other Guarda Superior panels. \n\n**The Integral Producer stamp is Cava's way of identifying producers who carry out the entire winemaking process from start to finish [^4].**\n\n[^4]: Producers can buy grapes but cannot buy wine. I'm assuming this is due to the historical context of wineries supporting many smaller grape growers.\n\nRegarding current trends, she mentioned that 100% Xarel·lo wines are being experimented with, due to their ageing potential. Rose wines also continue increasing in popularity.\n\n# Cava blind tasting\n\n![Cava tasting session](./img2.webp)\n\nNext, [David Forer MW](https://davidforermw.com/) led us through a blind tasting of various Cava flights. He noted that culturally Cava is less of a special occasion drink, and more of a 'meet up with friends for tapas' drink. \n\nSeparately, he mentioned how Cava has not required dosage for a while given the hot climate ripening grapes sufficiently, resulting in many Brut Nature (\u003C3 g/l) wines. He also likes to age his Cava, unless they were already late disgorged.\n\nThe first flight we tasted showed how the difference in ageing times affected aromas and flavours. David finds that ageing in Cava tends to show most in the change from primary to secondary and tertiary notes, such as from fresh to dried fruit. This is in contrast to Champagne where the autolytic character comes through more.\n\nThe second flight showed the difference in the varietals. Typical markers for each were:\n\n- Macabeo: honey, peach, richness\n- Xarel·lo: signature grape for Cava, with earthy, herbal, fennel notes, structure\n- Parellada: floral\n- Chardonnay: crisp, bread, dairy\n- Pinot Noir: red fruit, strawberry\n- Garnacha: crisp, crunchy, delicious\n\nThe third flight was our chance to identify age and variety. The dairy, goat cheese notes from aged Chardonnay in Cava helped me call one glass correctly. The earthy, herbal notes from Xarel·lo also helped our group identify the most aged wine. Identifying the two remaining wines that were mid-range in age and mixed varieties was difficult though. As always, blind tasting is a humbling experience.\n\n# Visit to Oliver Viticultors\n\n![Oliver Viticulators](./img3.webp)\n\nAfter lunch, we visited [Oliver Viticultors](https://oliverviticultors.com/en/home/). They have a long history as grape growers, and re-started making their own wines 11 years ago. Oliver has an estate closer to the sea, and another that is higher altitude with correspondingly cooler temperatures.\n\n## Grape growing\n\nOliver grows organically and biodynamically. They try to return what they use to the soil as much as, such as using pruned branches for compost rather than burning. They encourage natural grass cover, using the grass grown as an indicator of soil health.\n\nPruning is of high importance, since it determines the yield for the next year. It also requires higher skill and experience compared to harvesting [^5], which is why they use the same team for pruning where possible.\n\n[^5]: The son noted how he had pruning classes as part of his degree, but the real world is messier than classroom conditions, and he defers to his dad's experience in pruning\n\nThey primarily prune using electric scissors or by hand secateurs, minimising the use of tractors. They dislike the compaction and contamination from tractor pruning.\n\nOliver has vines up to 90 years old. **They view Macabeo and Xarel·lo as more important for Cava style.** Xarel·lo has had issues lately due to the drought, with vines dying from the heat. They are replanting to replace the Xarel·lo, and also planting more of Malvasia, Garnacha, and Sumoll.\n\nTheir harvest is roughly 1.5 months long, typically in the order of Macabeo, then Xarel·lo, then Paralleda.\n\n## Winemaking\n\n> If you work so hard in the vineyard and then add so much sugar it doesn't make sense - Oliver Viticultors\n\nOliver uses a pneumatic press and avoids oxidation as much as possible, also avoiding hotter midday temperatures.\n\nThey use both gyropalette and hand riddling [^6]. For their hand riddling, they have a special step in the process that they like to do for better integration of flavours [^7]. \n\n[^6]: Riddling is a process in sparkling wine production where the bottles with yeast still inside them are turned slowly so that the yeast eventually falls to the neck of the bottle and can be removed. As the thick part of the yeast falls faster than the thin part, rushing this process results in hazy wine rather than clear wine.\n\n[^7]: I won't detail this just in case it was sensitive information\n\nThey use a machine for disgorgement, and freeze the neck of the bottle before doing so. Their intent is to keep as much liquid as possible in the disgorgement process, as they typically make brut nature styles.\n\nThey like making brut nature as they want to showcase the result of their hard work from the grape growing process, and feel that adding too much dosage will mask that. \n\nMost bottles age with crown caps, but **they have noticed that cork can help with bottles that age on lees beyond five years.**\n\nFor ageing, they like to focus on acidity and structure to withstand the ageing process. Their Gran Reserva style aims to be fresh, such that you want to keep drinking it, and not have so much body that you feel full early. \n\n# Visit to Vins El Cep\n\n![Vins El Cep](./img4.webp)\n\nWe then headed to [Vins El Cep](https://vinselcep.com/en/), which was born from the union of four winegrower families in 1980, and dates back even longer to 1448 if counting the wine growing years.\n\nThey are essentially a small private co-operative, with each family managing their own estate, selling grapes but also making wine.\n\nTheir location has a mosaic of soils, more sandy than clay, which gives more minerality in the wines. \n\n**Vins El Cep is one of the wineries that has a [Paraje Calificado](https://www.cava.wine/en/categories-types/cava-de-paraje-calificado/), Can Prats.**  They qualified for this using a plot each of their Macabeo, Xarel·lo, Parellada, with the combined 3 plots forming the paraje. They feel that the paraje qualification is more specific than the Grand Cru qualification in Champagne, as parajes are smaller areas [^paraje].\n\n[^paraje]: If you submit 3 plots for the paraje qualification, you can blend grapes from those plots. However, if you had only submitted the Macabeo plot, you would not be able to blend the Xarel·lo or Parellada for your paraje wines\n\nThey like Xarel·lo for the body and structure, and Parellada for the floral aromatics.\n\nThey do also plant other varieties, having planted Chardonnay and Pinot Noir since the 1990s [^8].\n\n[^8]: They have other varieties beyond these as well but I didn't have time to write them down. I believe there was a Tempranillo?\n\nThey taste every three months to check for quality. **They typically age their paraje wines in cork,** as they also feel this is better quality for ageing longer than five years on lees. \n\n# Visit to Pares Balta\n\n![Pares Balta](./img8.webp)\n\nOur final visit of the day was to [Pares Balta](https://paresbalta.com/en/?v=0b3b97fa6688), to learn more about the traditional method from Marta Casas [^Marta].\n\n[^Marta]: Marta was recently awarded [Winemaker of the Year](https://paresbalta.com/en/marta-casas-from-pares-balta-recognized-as-winemaker-of-the-year-by-tim-atkin-mw/?v=0b3b97fa6688) in Catalan\n\nPares Balta has been certified organic sicne 2002, and biodynamic since 2012. **They are one of the few Integral Producers of Cava as well.**\n\nSome details discussed included:\n\n1. If a bottle was from the 2019 harvest, it typically requires 3 weeks of fermentation, and more weeks for clarification. This results in tirage in 2020 [^9]. Hence, five years of lees ageing would imply a 2025 disgorgement date for the 2019 harvest, not 2024\n\n2. They like to use 24g of sugar for tirage in Gran Reserva vs 20g of sugar for other categories, due to the longer ageing time of Gran Reserva resulting in more pressure lost\n\n3.

[We have a] long history, it's my legacy - \nEva Plazas Torné\n\nWe started the day with a visit to Vilarnau to learn more about their winemaking process, and the coupage (blending) process in particular, from  winemaker [Eva Plazas Torné](https://www.instagram.com/evacavawinemaker/?hl=en).\n\nVilarnau dates back to 1448 as grape growers, and was bought by Gonzalez Byass in 1982. \n\nThey have a 20 hectare estate, mainly in the valley area between Montserrat and Serralada Litoral. They also buy grapes from growers they contract with [^1]. \n\n[^1]: Their typical contract is for 5 years, and they frame this as a partnership to help protect growers survival.\n\nTheir soil typically has 3 layers, of clay, pebbles, and sand. \n\n## Grape growing\n\nTheir grape growing is 100% organic. They do use irrigation in line with regulatory standards, which can be important for chardonnay in years of drought. \n\nThere has been a push for more sustainability as well, such as usage of solar panels, biomass boilers.\n\nClimate change has resulted in a different order of harvest than usual, with Macabeo now being harvest even earlier than Chardonnay or Pinot Noir might have been. \n\n**Overall, harvest times for all varieties are also moving earlier.** They typically harvest from August to September. They harvest at night by machine, and up to midday by hand.\n\nThey like to prune Chardonnay and Xarel·lo later, because these two varieties are more sensitive to spring frost, due to budding early but ripening relatively late.\n\n## Winemaking\n\nEva presses without stems as she prefers high acidity for the base wines, and stems are typically too green given the earlier harvest time [^2]. \n\n[^2]: She might retain stems for still wine production as they will be less green by then.\n\nThey use a pneumatic press, and the second press fraction is typically for distillation and not wine production. \n\nTemperatures are cool during pressing to retain aromas, and particularly cooler for Parellada.\n\nShe likes using specific commercial yeasts for the first fermentation, each grape variety getting its own yeast. Fermentation typically takes 20 to 30 days. She has been experimenting with chestnut barrel fermentation for Xarel·lo, and we got to try one of these as well. \n\n## Coupage\n\n![Coupage](./img1.webp)\n\nWe also got to try our hands at making our own blends! \n\nWe were given a variety of base wines of different varieties with different alcohol and acidity levels, and told to create a blend that we liked.\n\nThe two main questions to answer before blending are:\n\n1. How much volume you need\n2. What type of Cava do you want to make\n\nThis is how she views the grape varieties:\n\n- Macabeo: important for Cava style. Fruity, green apple, pear. Because of its thin skin and compact clusters there is risk of botrytis, hence gluconic acid measurement is required\n- Xarel·lo: adds structure, bitterness, ageing potential. Because of its thick skin it is easier for organic farming\n- Parellada: high acidity, lemon flavours\n\n**Wines that are meant to age require higher acid,** as they will not have life and encounter oxidation problems without enough acid.\n\nShe tastes every 6 months to check for quality.\n\n**She has also been experimenting with using less bentonite in clarification [^bentonite].**\n\n[^bentonite]: Bentonite is a type of clay that helps to clarify wine, but there is a concern that using too much of it can strip flavour as well\n\nOur group experimented with many blends in an attempt to make a Gran Reserva (non-rose), and it was difficult to decide between which we liked more on tasting, and which we thought would hold up with age. Despite that, we won and got to take home some Vilarnau honey as a prize [^prize].\n\n[^prize]: This might have been due to other groups being disqualified due to mixing some of the Garnacha provided to us, in an attempt to make rose blends. Turns out, this is not allowed by regulation, and rose must be made from grapes directly and not base wines. Sneaky.\n\n# Visit to Codorniu\n\n![Codorniu](./img2.webp)\n\nNext, we visited Codorniu for a tour of the estate and lunch.\n\n[Codorniu](https://www.codorniu.com/en) is one of the largest producers of Cava, with historical documents dating back to 1551 showing the owner making wine then. \n\nCodorniu produces for both ends of the market, [making about 45mm bottles annually](https://spanishwinelover.com/winerie/codorniu) but also owning 3 parajes for the highest quality Cava production.\n\nOur visit was focused more on the history of the estate and less on the grape growing and wine making. We learnt that they have 30km of cellar space, with >60mm bottles stored, and got to tour part of the cellars as well.\n\nWe had lunch at Codorniu, where we had an excellent pairing of their Gran Reserva, Paraje, and Rose with our meals [^3]. \n\n[^3]: We got to taste their La Pleta Chardonnay Paratge Qualificat from 2014, which was one of 3377 bottles from that vintage. Paratge Qualificat is Catalan for Paraje Calificado\n\n# Exam time\n\nAfter that, it was time for our exam back at the D.O.\n\nThe exam was harder than expected, and I do wish there had been more study material provided, or that I had prepared more beforehand by revising other material on the D.O. website. \n\nThat said, I still passed! That means I have a Cava Educator Advanced certification now.\n\nWe finished with a certification presentation ceremony and a short celebration, before most of us had to catch the bus back to the airport or Barcelona city center.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n![Exam](./img5.webp)\n\nI'm grateful for the opportunity from the D.O. to take this course, which was a fantastic experience. Judith, Andrea, David, and everyone from all the wineries (Oliver, Vins El Cep, Parés Baltà, Vilarnau, Codorníu) provided both an educational and fun journey through all parts of the Cava production process.\n\n**I would highly recommend anyone interested in sparkling wines or Spanish wines to go through the various levels required to be eligible to apply for this course, and then experiencing this yourself in person.**\n\nMoving forward, I'm also looking for more opportunities to promote Cava both in NYC and in Singapore.","src/content/blog/2026_02_06_cava_educator_advanced_two/index.md",[252,123,250,248,251],"2ee26805da88e8a5",{"html":314,"metadata":315},"\u003Cp>This is notes from the second day of the Cava Educator Advanced course, \u003Ca href=\"www.linlib.com/writing/cava_educator_advanced/\">see here for the introduction and notes from the first day.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The second day included two winery visits and our exam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"visit-to-vilarnau\">Visit to Vilarnau\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./img4.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Vilarnau&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>My life is here.
