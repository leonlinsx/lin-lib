That turned into learning how to draw, to better appreciate art history. With the recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) trend, I wanted to share what I learnt about art today, and then discuss NFTs in a follow up post [^1].\n\n## 1. What is pure art?\n\nI've been primarily using [smarthistory](https://smarthistory.org/ 'smart') to learn art history, though the video that kick started my journey was [this MoMa one on how to paint like Picasso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGZYfSzvPvs&list=PLfYVzk0sNiGEZXlIltPP7Yy_s5gTM7hf8 'moma').\n\nI've also touched on art history before with articles on [Picasso](https://leonlins.com/writing/2020_04_08_picasso/ 'picasso') and [Manet](https://leonlins.com/writing/2020_12_09_art/ 'manet') if you want to check those out.\n\n**The most important thing I learnt about art history is to be open-minded.**\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nSuppose someone were to come to you and say, \"I'm sick of the fake art of today, I want to see real, pure art.\"\n\nWhat would you show them?\n\nPerhaps you would show them [The School of Athens,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens 'school') a painting by Raphael during the height of the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s. With its realistic portrayal of famous philosophers and use of [linear perspective](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)> 'perspective') to make things look 3D, the famous fresco is seen as a masterpiece epitomising the Renaissance.\n\n![post](./a_1.webp)\n\nOr perhaps you'd reject historical subjects, thinking that art shouldn't need to have a moral lesson attached. Instead, you show a 1800s painting by Dominique Ingres that's pure pleasure and fantasy, claiming that real art doesn't have to be realistic. [La Grand Odalisque looks realistic on first glance, but taking a closer look shows that the spine is weirdly long, and the back leg is attached at a weird angle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Odalisque 'wiki')\n\n![post](./a_2.webp)\n\nYou might say that pleasure is superficial, and it's purer to commemorate modern suffering, such as in Goya's 1800s [The Third of May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808 'may'). It's less realistic than the works earlier, with the figures being flatter and less finished. It's also no longer make-believe, since it depicts an actual tragedy during Goya's time [^2]. It was such a departure from previous tradition it's been called \"one of the first paintings of the modern era.\"\n\n![post](./a_3.webp)\n\nBut why limit painting to showing just one snapshot in time? What if instead you saw an object from all sorts of angles, and tried to put that down onto the flat canvas? Think Matrix bullet time, but as a painting; wouldn't that be more true to the object? Showing a cubist piece like Picasso's 1900s [Girl with a Mandolin](https://www.pablopicasso.org/girl-with-mandolin.jsp 'girl') would be a good choice then, with its attempt at showing a 3D someone from multiple points of views on a 2D surface.\n\n![post](./a_4.webp)\n\nAnd you could say all of the above is pretentious, and that art is just colours and lines on canvas. Showing a 1900s Mondrian makes the point that we shouldn't deceive ourselves with realism. Pure art is platonic shapes [^3].\n\n![post](./a_5.webp)\n\nI could go on; there's as many art movements as there are cryptocurrencies. The main point I want to make though is that art is subjective, and keeping an open mind is essential. Discussing whether something is art or not is one of those unanswerable philosophical questions.\n\nMany new movements were criticised during their time, only to become inspiration for generations of artists after [^4]. For many artists, pushing the boundary is the point.\n\nIt's ok to not like something - I still don't get most contemporary art. But to dismiss something just because you don't like it will limit your understanding of the world. And that's no fun.\n\n## 2. Being flexible in art\n\nI also started learning to draw last year for a couple of reasons:\n\n- As part of my neverending quest to stop getting stereotyped [^5]\n- To better appreciate how artists were creating their work, and distinguish between skill and bullshit\n- I was thinking about skills that I could work on for a long time, and ones I could continue into old age\n- Add to my toolbox of ways to communicate and express myself\n\nI started with [draw a box](https://drawabox.com/ 'draw'), and then moved on to [New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/ 'nma'), which I'm still using [^6]. I mainly work with pencil and fountain pen [^7].\n\nAs a sidenote, if [aphantasia is real](https://leonlins.com/writing/2019_07_31_aphantasia/ 'abp'), I probably have it, seeing as I'm a 3-4 on the below test. It hasn't been a hurdle when drawing from reference, though it might be one when drawing from imagination.\n\n![post](./a_6.webp)\n\nRoughly a year of daily practice and 600 pieces of paper later [^8], here's a progress pic. And yes, they're meant to be the same person:\n\n![post](./a_7.webp)\n\nAnd here's what I've learnt along the way:\n\n**Drawing is a skill,** and talent is overrated. I have no talent, as can be seen in that first pic. But regular practice will deliver results, and you can slowly get better over time. Talent helps, but it's not the only factor.\n\n**You're drawing, not copying.** The drawing will stand alone after you're done, since people won't see the reference. You can and should make any changes you want for a more interesting piece. It's made me less interested in hyper realistic pieces; why not just take a photograph [^9].\n\n**You learn tools, not rules.** The lessons teach you ways of doing things, but not the only way of doing things.\n\n**Small things make a big difference.** Drawing in pencil is distinct from drawing in pen (try it!). Small markings on a portrait can change how the entire drawing feels.\n\n**Rushing ruins the work.** Every time I tried to rush through a piece, it turned out bad. The better pieces I've done were all patiently built up in layers, though taking a long time doesn't guarantee quality. And it usually requires multiple sketches before producing a good piece.\n\nAs intimidating as it was, I'm glad I picked up drawing. I may not ever be an expert, but it's a lot of fun [^10]! And we could all use more fun things to learn.\n\n## Other\n\n1.

Much of our lives are decided by algorithms. Knowing what algorithms to follow can result in more efficient and effective decision making.\n\n## Algorithms in life\n\nI recently re-read [Algorithms to Live By](https://algorithmstoliveby.com/ 'algo'), a book by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths on how algorithms can help us be more effective in our lives. Having picked up programming last year, I got more out of this time around.\n\nAn algorithm is a process, and you can think of it as instructions to follow to complete some task. For example, learning how to add numbers together is a simple algorithm [^1].\n\nMore complex instructions can calculate results for other problems in life. Interest rates, web search rankings, or social media feeds are all based on the output of algorithms. The book goes through many such algorithms, and relates them to problems you might face personally.\n\nIt's too difficult to explain every algorithm they mention [^2], so instead I'll be doing short highlights from some, and usually concentrating on the qualitative, not quantitative takeaways.\n\nAlso, most of the algorithms rely on certain assumptions; rather than specify that every time, take that as a given when reading. I'll add some of the assumptions in footnotes for those interested.\n\nSome of the problems discussed include:\n\n- When to stop interviewing for the max chance of the best outcome\n- When you should stop exploring new options to enjoy the ones you already know\n- How to schedule your tasks based on what your goal is\n\nLet's look at our first algorithm, on when you should stop working on a problem.\n\n## Optimal stopping\n\nIf you're evaluating options (job applicants, housing offers, parking spaces etc), there's a tradeoff between how long you spend choosing, and the chance of picking the \"best\" option. This is known as the [secretary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem 'prob') - suppose you were hiring a secretary, how many interviews should you do to get the best chance of finding the best one?\n\nIn this case, there's a precise percentage to use. You should wait after seeing 37% of the applicant pool, and then take the next best applicant you see [^3]. For example, if you had 100 applicants, wait after you've seen the first 37, and then pick the next applicant that is better than all you've seen so far.\n\nThat is the mathematically optimal point with the highest chance of picking the best person for the job. If you stop too early, you might miss someone interviewing later. If you stop too late, you waste time [^4].\n\n![post](./a_1.webp)\n\n## Explore exploit\n\nSimilar to the optimal stopping situation, there's a tradeoff between information gathering (explore) and enjoying (exploit). Suppose you're at a casino, and want to decide which machines to play. You want to maximise your winnings, but don't know the exact odds for the machines (if you did, you'd play the best one).\n\nIn this case, there's a number, known as the [Gittins Index](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2017sp/lecnotes/6840sp17R_Kleinberg.pdf 'gittins'), that gives you the optimal machine to play [^5]. If you know the number of wins, losses, and how much you value future gains, you can calculate precise values for each choice. Some interesting properties:\n\n- If you're playing the optimal machine and win again, it makes sense to continue playing that machine\n- If you're playing the optimal machine and lose once, it might still make sense to continue playing that machine\n- An entirely unknown machine can be preferable to machines that are known to win often, and that unknown machine gets more valuable the more you value future gains\n\nSome other related implications:\n\n- Exploration has a higher impact younger in life; babies putting everything in their mouth makes sense from their standpoint\n- Exploiting has a higher impact later in life; hence older people cutting down their social network and preferring to return to favourite restaurants\n\n## Sorting\n\nThe book gave a few examples of sorting algorithms, which are commonly used in programming. For example, returning search results requires a sorting of the most relevant ones for you.\n\nI'll save more detailed discussion of sorting algos for another day since they require understanding [time complexity](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/ 'time'). Here are some qualitative takeaways:\n\n- Some ways of sorting can be drastically more efficient than others (>10x faster)\n- Some scenarios do not desire sort efficiency only. For example, arranging a sports season matchup calendar also requires taking into account how exciting the season will be. You could optimise sort efficiency, but the season will seem less thrilling\n- The more efficient a sort, the more fragile it might be against accidental mistakes. For example, the \"best\" team might accidentally get knocked out in a single elimination tournament (essentially a sorting algo) like the World Cup [^6].\n\n## Caching and memory\n\nThe idea of having a cache is to have 1) a small, fast memory (storage) section, and 2) a large, slow memory section. We'll then alternate between the two depending on what our intention is. This lets us get both some amount of speed and some amount of size for the activity we want.\n\nFor example, you might have your favourite clothes in your wardrobe, and your unused ones in the attic. You'd have quick access to the items you used the most, but still have space for that ugly christmas sweater if you wanted. Caching sounds complicated, but you'll realised we do it naturally for most of our daily lives.\n\nHow do you decide what items should be put in the fast section, and what items in the slow section? You could put random items, the newest item, the largest item etc.\n\nIn this case, keeping the most recently used items in the small and fast section is the optimal choice, due to something known as [temporal locality](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-spatial-locality-and-temporal-locality/ 'temp'). You're more likely to need something again that's something you've recently used. For example, google drive highlights your frequently used files for quick access.\n\n![post](./a_2.webp)\n\n## Scheduling\n\nMost of us have to decide how to prioritise items on our to do list. This usually requires making a tradeoff between responsiveness (how quickly you respond) and throughput (how much you can get done).\n\nA key point about scheduling and prioritisation is defining your goal metric, since that determines what algorithm you want to use [^7]. Maximising responsiveness comes at the expense of how much you can get done:\n\nIf you want to minimise the max lateness of all your projects [^8], the [Earliest Due Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-machine_scheduling 'EDT') algorithm tells you to start with the project due earliest.\n\nIf you want to minimise the total completion time, the [Shortest Processing Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-machine_scheduling 'spt') algorithm tells you to just do the quickest task first.\n\nIf your tasks are not equal in importance, then placing a weight on each task and calculating the weight over time required ratio will help you decide which task to do; pick the project with highest weight over time.\n\nPractically, this means that it's probably worth having a conversation with your manager on how the team thinks about this tradeoff, and which method they'd prefer you adopt.\n\nThere's another important concept in scheduling, which is the idea of [context switching](https://blog.doist.com/context-switching/ 'switch') - whenever you have to switch between tasks. Context switching is wasted time since it's not real work, but takes up time and effort on your part.\n\nFor example, if you were writing an email and then got interrupted by a slack message, it takes time for you to both respond to the slack message, and then remember what you wanted to do for the email.\n\nAt its worst, context switching turns to thrash, when you get nothing productive done because you're too busy with only switching. Ways to avoid thrash include:\n\n- Saying no to tasks, though the authors acknowledge we're often unable to do so\n- Working dumber and more inefficiently. Rather than think about the optimal way to get through your tasks, just start on something and get it done\n\n## Bayes rule and distributions\n\nExplaining Bayes rule would probably take an article on its own, so let's just take it as a rule that helps you with predicting how likely something is to occur [^9]. What the authors want to highlight is that this depends on the distribution that your events are coming from. There are three main distributions to think about:\n\n- Power law: the longer something has gone on, the longer we expect it to continue going on. For example, if a company has been growing a long time, we'd expect it to continue growing\n- Normal: early events are surprising, late events are expected. For example, we'd be surprised by people who die early in life, and not by people who die late in life.\n- Erlang: events are never any more or less surprising. For example, a memoryless distribution of a roulette wheel or [the coin flips we discussed last week](https://leonlins.com/writing/2021_04_03_ergodicity/ 'sub')\n\n![post](./a_3.webp)\n\n## Game theory\n\nMost of us have probably heard of game theory before, which is a way of thinking what the optimal strategy is when playing a game. Some highlights:\n\n- If you play too many levels above your opponent, you're going to think they have information they don't actually have, and they won't be able to think what you want them to think. Put another way, you don't want to get _too_ smart with your strategies\n- Every two player game has at least one [Nash Equilibrium,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium 'nash') where both players are choosing the optimal strategy for themselves\n- However, finding Nash equilibrium is an intractable problem, meaning there's limits to the practicality of game theory\n- The equilibrium may also not be the outcome that is best for all players. [It may be optimal for an individual to compete, but optimal for the group to cooperate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,working%20at%20RAND%20in%201950. 'wiki') We can quantify this as the \"price of anarchy\", which measures the gap between cooperation and competition.\n- There's also a counterintuitive concept known as [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design 'mech'), which shows that _worsening_ every outcome might actually make everyone better off, due to shifting the equilibrium\n\nBesides the algorithms mentioned above, the authors also go through:\n\n- When you might be overfitting your decision making process and what you can do about it\n- What to do when real world problems aren't as nice as theory and why you should relax constraints\n- How to think about information networking and how the internet works\n\nOverall I thought the book was worth reading to get an overview of interesting ways algorithms show up in life. I did understand it better _after_ learning some computer science though, so keep that in mind. I also wish that they'd included more practical examples [^10], since trying to apply the findings to life can be difficult when you have to work off different assumptions.\n\n[^1]: Easy enough to teach children, by telling them to memorise sums and when to carry a number, but surprisingly not obvious when trying to implement on a computer, see [full adder logic gate](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html 'full')\n\n[^2]: You might say that by the time I explain everything, I might as well have [written the entire book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem 'p np')\n\n[^3]: [The percentage is 1 divided by e, euler's number.](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-4/issue-3/Who-Solved-the-Secretary-Problem/10.1214/ss/1177012493.full 'problem') The chance doesn't change as the size of the applicant pool grows, but does change with different information states you get\n\n[^4]: The base secretary problem assumes that you can't go back to a candidate that you passed on, but there are variations that resemble real life a bit more closely.\n\n[^5]: This problem is intractable if the probabilities of a payoff on a machine change over time; essentially meaning it's unsolvable. Some problems are intractable. In these cases, relaxing some constraints and accepting solutions that are \"close enough\" helps us significantly in structuring the problem.\n\n[^6]: Or March Madness, for the Americans\n\n[^7]: Only 9% of all scheduling problems can be solved efficiently.\n\n[^8]: As in, take all your projects that are late, and then the maximum of those. That's the metric you want to minimise.\n\n[^9]: See [here](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/ 'bayes') for an article that explains Bayes. Bayes is unintuitive (for me at least), which also means its good to know\n\n[^10]: To be fair, there's a good amount of information in the footnotes elaborating more","src/content/blog/2021_04_10_algo/index.md",[24,25,26],"8a032e645107429d",{"html":72,"metadata":73},"\u003Ch2 id=\"takeaway\">Takeaway\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>An algorithm is a defined process to follow to get a desired result.

It has been lightly edited for clarity and web reading.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCava has a bright, some might even say sparkling, future as we look towards future growth trends, as long as it is willing to adopt some unconventional ideas while still holding on to its rich tradition and history.\n\nIn this paper I will discuss:\n\n1.  Wine and Cava specific growth rates, as context for how to project the future\n\n2.  Growth areas for Cava, based on current consumption data\n\n3.  Marketing ideas for Cava in consideration of the above\n\n# Wine and Cava specific growth rates\n\nUnderstanding the macroeconomic context of the global wine industry is essential for projecting Cava's trajectory. This section examines declining alcohol consumption patterns, the divergent performance of wine categories, and why sparkling wines—particularly Cava—present a compelling growth opportunity despite broader market headwinds.\n\n## Overall wine market decline\n\nBy now, it is no secret that the wine industry overall is facing difficulties. Alcohol consumption has declined in all major markets as part of a pattern 50 years in the making, and we should not expect a reversal in habits any time soon. Health, prices, habits have all changed, and the wine world is adapting to this new reality.\n\n![Chart showing overall wine consumption trends](./image1.webp)\n\n*Figure 1: Wine consumption trends across major markets, illustrating the 50-year decline in overall alcohol consumption.*\n\nHowever, this decline in growth is not affecting the wine world evenly. Still wines have suffered the most, but sparkling wines have either had smaller declines, or even growth in some years.\n\n![Chart showing sparkling versus still wine growth](./image11.webp)\n\n*Figure 2: Comparative growth trends for sparkling and still wine categories, highlighting the outperformance of sparkling wines.*\n\n## Sparkling wine outlook and category divergence\n\nThe outlook for sparkling wines is also better than for still wines. According to IWSR, among the 3 major categories of still, sparkling, and fortified wine, the sparkling category is expected to have +1% cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2027, unlike still wine which is expected to further decline with a -1% CAGR. It is a much better time to be a sparkling wine producer compared to a still wine producer, all other things being equal.\n\nThis divergence in outlooks becomes even clearer once we segment the data by country. Countries such as Portugal, Argentina, Canada have had >20% growth rates in volume of sparkling wine in 2024. Clearly, concluding that all of the wine world in all countries is declining is too generic of a statement, and misses the subtleties of consumer demand in some areas.\n\nHuge opportunities in wine sales still exist, but understanding the market and consumer has become even more relevant in this fragmented age. There are still pockets of growth, but we must be more intentional in targeting these subsets. We should keep this in mind as we think about Cava's future internationally.\n\n![Chart showing regional sparkling wine growth](./image5.webp)\n\n*Figure 3: Regional sparkling wine growth rates by country, demonstrating significant variation in market performance.*\n\nGiven the volume growth projections, there is clearly still demand globally for sparkling wine, even more so in particular countries. It is now the moment for Cava to seize this opportunity to expand its customer base, and build the top of funnel marketing base for future growth. Doing so now, while being able to take advantage of the momentum of sparkling wine overall, will make the campaign much easier compared to attempting to reverse a decline, should that happen in the future. This is why it is essential for Cava to lay the groundwork now, to reap the benefits of brand recognition a few years down the line.\n\n## Cava's performance relative to competing sparkling wines\n\nLooking closer at sparkling wine data split by major types, we see that Prosecco has been the main driver of volume growth in the past few years. This is in contrast to Cava, Champagne, Franciacorta growth being mostly flat.\n\nIn situations like these with diverging growth rates, we should:\n\n1.  Accept reality, and acknowledge the difference in sales volumes\n\n2.  Identify what Prosecco has been doing to continue growing\n\n3.  Assess what Cava would want to adopt, and what not to adopt, given its own culture\n\n4.  Get buy in from all stakeholders on how to develop Cava further\n\n5.  Set aside a long enough timeframe to implement the changes required\n\n![Chart showing sparkling wine category performance](./image7.webp)\n\n*Figure 4: Comparative performance of major sparkling wine categories (Prosecco, Cava, Champagne, Franciacorta), showing volume and growth divergence.*\n\n## Lessons from Prosecco's success\n\nProsecco has benefited from several key advantages that have driven its market ascendancy:\n\n1.  Inexpensive price point, particularly compared to Champagne\n\n2.  Easy to drink, light, fruity, refreshing profile\n\n3.  Rebranding of the region and Glera grape in 2009\n\n4.  Marketing, publicity, and association with the Italian lifestyle\n\nCava can learn from the above, but with its own flavour:\n\n1.  While inexpensive and premium Cava will always still play an important role, there is likely a price point just above that of\n    Prosecco, that is still affordable enough for the regular consumer,\n    but also helping to signal higher quality. Emphasise the quality and\n    value for money, but not the price\n\n2.  The citrus notes, high acidity, light body are plus points in favour\n    of Cava, and should be leaned into more when promoting. The ability\n    to pair well with food is also another huge bonus that more people\n    need to be educated on; Cava promotional events and tastings should\n    be conducted with food by default. In the completely opposite\n    direction, longer lees aging times will help create products\n    appealing to the niche super premium consumer segment, which will\n    help with growth in value but not volume\n\n3.  Continuing with the current educational series (e.g. Cava Academy)\n    and building the community for that will pay off in the medium term,\n    as wine educators and bar managers will have Cava top of mind for\n    them. The Cava brand name should continue to be the focus, rather\n    than individual grapes - think about how many people know Prosecco\n    but how few know what grape it uses\n\n4.  Regional, hyperlocal, specific products and experiences are trendy\n    now. Cava should strongly emphasise the unique Spanish nature of the\n    wine and the major zones. The sub zones are also a step in the right\n    direction to increase the appeal for the premium price point\n    consumer\n\nCava should not aim to compete or price, or brand itself as affordable\nChampagne, as that marketing strategy just increases customer awareness\nof other competitors while lowering the quality perception of Cava.\n\nCava should also not change its traditional methods of grape growing and\nproduction, and in fact actually lean into these aspects even more, in a\nworld where everything is becoming commoditised and identical.\n\n# Growth areas for Cava\n\nPart of Cava's struggles the past 3 years have been due to the drought in Spain, leading to poor yields, scarce supply, and drop in sales volumes internationally. However, given that this is a temporary supply side issue rather than a demand side decline, we can expect a recovery in key markets, assuming the supply problems are resolved.\n\nIdentifying high-potential markets requires a systematic approach combining consumption data, tourism patterns, and cultural alignment. This section outlines methods for market selection and proposes priority markets for Cava's expansion strategy.\n\n## Market selection methodology\n\nThere are a few ways to identify key growth countries for Cava.\n\nFirstly, taking a look at the largest markets for sparkling wine sales,\nwe see the following top 5 areas, per Wine Australia:\n\n![Chart showing top 5 sparkling wine markets](./image6.webp)\n\nFrance, Italy, and Germany have the majority of their sparkling wine\nsales as a direct consequence of their own local production methods. For\nexample, France has 92% local sparkling wine, and Italy has 83% local.\nIn contrast, the United States and United Kingdom continue to be mainly\nimporters of sparkling wine, making them large markets.\n\nThis does not mean that the United States and United Kingdom are the\nonly possible markets for Cava. Instead, it means that the marketing\napproach for Cava should differ across these top 5 countries. In\ncountries with high local sparkling wine production, we can build\ncuriosity about Cava rather than present Cava as a foreign competitor.\nIn countries with high import percentages, we can emphasise the Spanish\nangle and history.\n\n## Growth markets identified by category performance\n\nSecondly, referring back to the graph of sparkling wine growth by country discussed earlier, we see these countries as bright spots for growth:\n\n1.  Portugal\n\n2.  Argentina\n\n3.  Canada\n\n4.  Chile\n\n5.  Italy\n\nBesides Italy, which was just mentioned above in the overall sparkling wine sales section, the rest of the markets are additions to the list of potential growth markets for Cava. Building the brand presence there now while the countries are still experiencing sales momentum will help accelerate growth efforts in the future.\n\nThe main idea should be to build awareness of Cava on both the inexpensive and premium price points, through Spanish cultural and food pairing themed events in those countries. We do not want to position ourselves as a cheap Champagne alternative or a Prosecco permutation, but want to constantly reinforce the Spanish heritage and history.\n\n## Cava and tourism: Leveraging Spain's visitor base\n\nThirdly, another way of identifying interesting countries for Cava is by taking a look at the top inbound tourism countries visiting Spain as a whole, and the Catalunya region in particular. It is likely that promoting the Spanish connection and heritage of Cava will be effective when selling into these countries, given the inherent interest of the consumer base.\n\n![Inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya by country](./image10.webp)\n\n*Figure 5: Top source countries for inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya, showing tourism flows that correlate with Cava promotional opportunities.*\n\n**Data sources**: [ine.es](http://ines.es), [idescat.cat](http://idescat.cat)\n\nBased on the above, some other countries not previously identified include the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland. Although most of these are naturally European countries due to the ease of tourism, note that Canada does appear in the top 10 list of tourist arrivals for the Catalunya region specifically.\n\nWine tourism for Cava is definitely a possibility, but growth efforts can take an even lighter touch than that. Working together with private\ntour agencies, public government boards, the Cava DO can make itself\nmore visible at major tourist locations and events, to continue building\nawareness of the Spanish sparkling wine. It should be a stretch goal for\nevery tourist leaving Spain to have had at least a taste of Cava while\nthey were there. Airport tastings, winery tours, restaurant partnerships\nare all ways that this can be made to happen.\n\n## Target markets for concentrated growth efforts\n\nWe now have a good list of target markets to start with. To narrow it down, here are 3 proposed markets for growth, and also 3 underrated markets that could be interesting.\n\n**Growth markets**: United Kingdom, Portugal, Argentina\n\n**Underrated markets**: Canada, Belgium, Japan\n\nNote that while Japan did not make the lists in the above cuts, it is added in here due to market knowledge of how the sparkling wine market is still growing there due to their culture and desire for premium drinks. Using it as a testing ground for marketing ideas can also help with land and expand efforts for the rest of the Asian market.\n\nThe market identification above is for focused outreach efforts, and is not meant to imply that other markets should be neglected. For example, it would be foolish to ignore the United States and not sell into it, given the size of the market there. However, we can likely get more return on marketing spend by making targeted campaigns for other relatively less competitive regions instead, and reinvest the revenue for more growth. The intent should be to build reinforcing growth loops that are self-funding.\n\n# Marketing ideas for Cava\n\nHaving identified promising markets and understood Cava's competitive positioning, we now turn to unconventional promotional strategies that maintain brand integrity while building awareness. The following ideas prioritize long-term brand development and differentiation over short-term volume gains, ensuring Cava is positioned as a distinct Spanish product rather than a Champagne or Prosecco alternative.\n\nThe ideas may be less tried and true, but we want to always ensure that we still maintain the consistency of Cava, and respect the traditional ways of grape growing and wine production. We do not compromise on quality, but we do experiment with new promotional ideas.\n\nThree ideas for marketing Cava are:\n\n1.  Canned Cava\n\n2.  No and low alcohol (NOLO) Cava\n\n3.  Personalised Cava bottle labels with the help of generative AI\n\nCanned wine sales are a high growth product segment, with Future Market\nInsights estimating a 17% CAGR over the next decade. Contrasting this\nwith the decline in still wine sales overall, this represents a\ncompletely different paradigm, and Cava should capitalise on this trend.\n\n![Chart showing canned wine market growth](./image3.webp)\n\nCanned wine is becoming more popular due to convenience, ease of\ntransport, and smaller portion sizes. For a younger generation of\nconsumers that drinks less overall, it is easier to bring around smaller\ncans for drinks, rather than a bottle that they may not be able to\nfinish. Some people may perceive canned wine to be healthier as well,\ngiven that some canned wine is wine with soda water added, which\ndecreases the calories.\n\nSparkling wines are also a perfect pairing with the can format, due to\nthe effervescent connection with other sparkling drinks triggering a\nsense of familiarity with the wine drinker. Cava can make use of this\nconnection to offer quality wine in a trendy packaging format.\nNaturally, this would be more appropriate for the inexpensive, fruitier\nstyles of Cava.\n\nSurprisingly, all major markets are expected to have high growth for\ncanned wine, which means that this marketing approach should work for\nCava in all the suggested markets identified in the above growth areas\nsection.\n\n![Chart showing global canned wine market growth](./image2.webp)\n\nThe no and low alcohol (NOLO) market is also another bright spot for\nwine. Growth rates are double that of the overall wine market, and also\nexpected to be similar among major markets such as the US, Germany, and\nJapan. Health concerns, demographic changes, and improvements in product\nquality have resulted in this divergence of growth rates compared to\noverall wine.\n\n![Chart showing NOLO market growth trends](./image4.webp)\n\nAmong NOLO, sparkling wine has been the most attractive product category\nso far, due to the product quality being better received by consumers.\nUnder current technology, it is harder to re-integrate the flavours and\naromas removed during the de-alcoholisation process for red wines, which\nends up causing a decline in taste. The bubbles in NOLO sparkling wine\ncan help lift the flavours compared to NOLO still white wine, and make\nit more pleasant to drink. As a result, there are currently\nsignificantly more SKUs of NOLO sparkling wine than there are whites or\nreds. Cava is a natural fit for NOLO.\n\n![Chart showing NOLO sparkling wine category performance](./image8.webp)\n\nCava can take advantage of this to make NOLO versions as well, with some\neven in cans, that will appeal to the more health conscious consumer.\nThis would not be a novel idea. Vilarnau has already made two variants\nof Cava, a brut and a rose, that are without alcohol. As expected, the\ntasting profile of these variants are fresh and fruity, and the price is\ninexpensive. Cava should continue to push on this front while the trends\nare still in its favour, especially since it will take time for\nproducers to set up the production process for NOLO.\n\n![Vilarnau NOLO Cava product example](./image12.webp)\n\nNow that we've had 2 ideas for inexpensive Cava, the remaining idea is\nfor the premium and super premium Cava segment. The Cava de Paraje\nCalificado would be the ideal product type for this, and possibly even\nthe extremely long lees aging that some producers are experimenting with\nas well. The intent is to focus on smaller production, higher quality,\nso that the AI labelling idea is easier to execute.\n\nAt this price point and quality level, consumers are expecting unique\nproducts. What better way to do so, than make the bottle labelling\nunique per individual order, a result of their own design?\n\nWith the help of generative AI tools, consumers will be able to design\ntheir own bottle label, subject to a minimum order amount. Their premium\nCava case will be one of a kind, sure to scratch the collector's itch\nthat many of the clients in this segment have. A simple but more\nexpensive option would be to use paid tools such as Google AI Studio's\nNano Banana, which created this image below in less than a minute.\nImagine the possibilities for the consumer here.\n\n![Generative AI example for custom Cava label design](./image13.webp)\n\nThe more complicated but cheaper option in the long run would be to use\ncustom tools such as ComfyUI below together with purchased CPU and GPU\nhardware, to do the image generation ourselves. In other words, the\nwineries would have to buy the computing equipment, and set up the\nbackend and frontend software tools for users to be able to easily enter\ntext for image generation.\n\nAlthough this would be harder to set up, it would be cheaper after\ninitial capital costs are depreciated, due to the lower recurring cost\nnature vs the subscription and API fees for the paid tool options. There\nwould be more control over the entire end to end process as well.\n\n![ComfyUI workflow interface for image generation](./image9.webp)\n\nSource: ComfyUI\n\nThe premium price point of the product for this idea is required, due to\nthe higher effort and costs involved in producing the unique bottlings.\nSince we are targeting the high net worth customer segment, the\nincremental cost from the customisation is unlikely to impact demand.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCava has much to look forward to in the next decade, despite the worrying trends overall for the wine market. There still remain many countries where sparkling wine and especially Spanish wine will be growth engines. Cava can further take advantage of canned wine, NOLO, and generative AI tools to appeal more to the modern consumer. It does not have to change its cultural history, but it does have to experiment with new marketing approaches to expect changes in growth for the future.\n\n---\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">References\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\n- The art of drinks.

Alcohol consumption has declined in all major markets as part of a pattern 50 years in the making, and we should not expect a reversal in habits any time soon. Health, prices, habits have all changed, and the wine world is adapting to this new reality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image1.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing overall wine consumption trends&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Figure 1: Wine consumption trends across major markets, illustrating the 50-year decline in overall alcohol consumption.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, this decline in growth is not affecting the wine world evenly.

According to IWSR, among the 3 major categories of still, sparkling, and fortified wine, the sparkling category is expected to have +1% cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2027, unlike still wine which is expected to further decline with a -1% CAGR. It is a much better time to be a sparkling wine producer compared to a still wine producer, all other things being equal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This divergence in outlooks becomes even clearer once we segment the data by country. Countries such as Portugal, Argentina, Canada have had >20% growth rates in volume of sparkling wine in 2024. Clearly, concluding that all of the wine world in all countries is declining is too generic of a statement, and misses the subtleties of consumer demand in some areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Huge opportunities in wine sales still exist, but understanding the market and consumer has become even more relevant in this fragmented age. There are still pockets of growth, but we must be more intentional in targeting these subsets. We should keep this in mind as we think about Cava’s future internationally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image5.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing regional sparkling wine growth&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Figure 3: Regional sparkling wine growth rates by country, demonstrating significant variation in market performance.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given the volume growth projections, there is clearly still demand globally for sparkling wine, even more so in particular countries. It is now the moment for Cava to seize this opportunity to expand its customer base, and build the top of funnel marketing base for future growth. Doing so now, while being able to take advantage of the momentum of sparkling wine overall, will make the campaign much easier compared to attempting to reverse a decline, should that happen in the future. This is why it is essential for Cava to lay the groundwork now, to reap the benefits of brand recognition a few years down the line.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"cavas-performance-relative-to-competing-sparkling-wines\">Cava’s performance relative to competing sparkling wines\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Looking closer at sparkling wine data split by major types, we see that Prosecco has been the main driver of volume growth in the past few years.

The ability\nto pair well with food is also another huge bonus that more people\nneed to be educated on; Cava promotional events and tastings should\nbe conducted with food by default. In the completely opposite\ndirection, longer lees aging times will help create products\nappealing to the niche super premium consumer segment, which will\nhelp with growth in value but not volume\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Continuing with the current educational series (e.g. Cava Academy)\nand building the community for that will pay off in the medium term,\nas wine educators and bar managers will have Cava top of mind for\nthem.

However, given that this is a temporary supply side issue rather than a demand side decline, we can expect a recovery in key markets, assuming the supply problems are resolved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Identifying high-potential markets requires a systematic approach combining consumption data, tourism patterns, and cultural alignment. This section outlines methods for market selection and proposes priority markets for Cava’s expansion strategy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"market-selection-methodology\">Market selection methodology\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are a few ways to identify key growth countries for Cava.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, taking a look at the largest markets for sparkling wine sales,\nwe see the following top 5 areas, per Wine Australia:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image6.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing top 5 sparkling wine markets&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>France, Italy, and Germany have the majority of their sparkling wine\nsales as a direct consequence of their own local production methods. For\nexample, France has 92% local sparkling wine, and Italy has 83% local.\nIn contrast, the United States and United Kingdom continue to be mainly\nimporters of sparkling wine, making them large markets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This does not mean that the United States and United Kingdom are the\nonly possible markets for Cava. Instead, it means that the marketing\napproach for Cava should differ across these top 5 countries. In\ncountries with high local sparkling wine production, we can build\ncuriosity about Cava rather than present Cava as a foreign competitor.\nIn countries with high import percentages, we can emphasise the Spanish\nangle and history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"growth-markets-identified-by-category-performance\">Growth markets identified by category performance\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Secondly, referring back to the graph of sparkling wine growth by country discussed earlier, we see these countries as bright spots for growth:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Portugal\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Argentina\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Canada\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Chile\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Italy\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Besides Italy, which was just mentioned above in the overall sparkling wine sales section, the rest of the markets are additions to the list of potential growth markets for Cava. Building the brand presence there now while the countries are still experiencing sales momentum will help accelerate growth efforts in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main idea should be to build awareness of Cava on both the inexpensive and premium price points, through Spanish cultural and food pairing themed events in those countries. We do not want to position ourselves as a cheap Champagne alternative or a Prosecco permutation, but want to constantly reinforce the Spanish heritage and history.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"cava-and-tourism-leveraging-spains-visitor-base\">Cava and tourism: Leveraging Spain’s visitor base\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Thirdly, another way of identifying interesting countries for Cava is by taking a look at the top inbound tourism countries visiting Spain as a whole, and the Catalunya region in particular. It is likely that promoting the Spanish connection and heritage of Cava will be effective when selling into these countries, given the inherent interest of the consumer base.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image10.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya by country&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Figure 5: Top source countries for inbound tourism to Spain and Catalunya, showing tourism flows that correlate with Cava promotional opportunities.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Data sources\u003C/strong>: \u003Ca href=\"http://ines.es\">ine.es\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://idescat.cat\">idescat.cat\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Based on the above, some other countries not previously identified include the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland. Although most of these are naturally European countries due to the ease of tourism, note that Canada does appear in the top 10 list of tourist arrivals for the Catalunya region specifically.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wine tourism for Cava is definitely a possibility, but growth efforts can take an even lighter touch than that. Working together with private\ntour agencies, public government boards, the Cava DO can make itself\nmore visible at major tourist locations and events, to continue building\nawareness of the Spanish sparkling wine. It should be a stretch goal for\nevery tourist leaving Spain to have had at least a taste of Cava while\nthey were there. Airport tastings, winery tours, restaurant partnerships\nare all ways that this can be made to happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"target-markets-for-concentrated-growth-efforts\">Target markets for concentrated growth efforts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>We now have a good list of target markets to start with. To narrow it down, here are 3 proposed markets for growth, and also 3 underrated markets that could be interesting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Growth markets\u003C/strong>: United Kingdom, Portugal, Argentina\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Underrated markets\u003C/strong>: Canada, Belgium, Japan\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Note that while Japan did not make the lists in the above cuts, it is added in here due to market knowledge of how the sparkling wine market is still growing there due to their culture and desire for premium drinks. Using it as a testing ground for marketing ideas can also help with land and expand efforts for the rest of the Asian market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The market identification above is for focused outreach efforts, and is not meant to imply that other markets should be neglected. For example, it would be foolish to ignore the United States and not sell into it, given the size of the market there. However, we can likely get more return on marketing spend by making targeted campaigns for other relatively less competitive regions instead, and reinvest the revenue for more growth. The intent should be to build reinforcing growth loops that are self-funding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"marketing-ideas-for-cava\">Marketing ideas for Cava\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Having identified promising markets and understood Cava’s competitive positioning, we now turn to unconventional promotional strategies that maintain brand integrity while building awareness. The following ideas prioritize long-term brand development and differentiation over short-term volume gains, ensuring Cava is positioned as a distinct Spanish product rather than a Champagne or Prosecco alternative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ideas may be less tried and true, but we want to always ensure that we still maintain the consistency of Cava, and respect the traditional ways of grape growing and wine production. We do not compromise on quality, but we do experiment with new promotional ideas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Three ideas for marketing Cava are:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Canned Cava\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>No and low alcohol (NOLO) Cava\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Personalised Cava bottle labels with the help of generative AI\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Canned wine sales are a high growth product segment, with Future Market\nInsights estimating a 17% CAGR over the next decade. Contrasting this\nwith the decline in still wine sales overall, this represents a\ncompletely different paradigm, and Cava should capitalise on this trend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image3.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing canned wine market growth&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Canned wine is becoming more popular due to convenience, ease of\ntransport, and smaller portion sizes. For a younger generation of\nconsumers that drinks less overall, it is easier to bring around smaller\ncans for drinks, rather than a bottle that they may not be able to\nfinish. Some people may perceive canned wine to be healthier as well,\ngiven that some canned wine is wine with soda water added, which\ndecreases the calories.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sparkling wines are also a perfect pairing with the can format, due to\nthe effervescent connection with other sparkling drinks triggering a\nsense of familiarity with the wine drinker. Cava can make use of this\nconnection to offer quality wine in a trendy packaging format.\nNaturally, this would be more appropriate for the inexpensive, fruitier\nstyles of Cava.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Surprisingly, all major markets are expected to have high growth for\ncanned wine, which means that this marketing approach should work for\nCava in all the suggested markets identified in the above growth areas\nsection.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image2.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing global canned wine market growth&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The no and low alcohol (NOLO) market is also another bright spot for\nwine. Growth rates are double that of the overall wine market, and also\nexpected to be similar among major markets such as the US, Germany, and\nJapan. Health concerns, demographic changes, and improvements in product\nquality have resulted in this divergence of growth rates compared to\noverall wine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image4.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing NOLO market growth trends&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Among NOLO, sparkling wine has been the most attractive product category\nso far, due to the product quality being better received by consumers.\nUnder current technology, it is harder to re-integrate the flavours and\naromas removed during the de-alcoholisation process for red wines, which\nends up causing a decline in taste. The bubbles in NOLO sparkling wine\ncan help lift the flavours compared to NOLO still white wine, and make\nit more pleasant to drink. As a result, there are currently\nsignificantly more SKUs of NOLO sparkling wine than there are whites or\nreds. Cava is a natural fit for NOLO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image8.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Chart showing NOLO sparkling wine category performance&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cava can take advantage of this to make NOLO versions as well, with some\neven in cans, that will appeal to the more health conscious consumer.\nThis would not be a novel idea. Vilarnau has already made two variants\nof Cava, a brut and a rose, that are without alcohol. As expected, the\ntasting profile of these variants are fresh and fruity, and the price is\ninexpensive. Cava should continue to push on this front while the trends\nare still in its favour, especially since it will take time for\nproducers to set up the production process for NOLO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image12.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Vilarnau NOLO Cava product example&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now that we’ve had 2 ideas for inexpensive Cava, the remaining idea is\nfor the premium and super premium Cava segment. The Cava de Paraje\nCalificado would be the ideal product type for this, and possibly even\nthe extremely long lees aging that some producers are experimenting with\nas well. The intent is to focus on smaller production, higher quality,\nso that the AI labelling idea is easier to execute.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At this price point and quality level, consumers are expecting unique\nproducts. What better way to do so, than make the bottle labelling\nunique per individual order, a result of their own design?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the help of generative AI tools, consumers will be able to design\ntheir own bottle label, subject to a minimum order amount. Their premium\nCava case will be one of a kind, sure to scratch the collector’s itch\nthat many of the clients in this segment have. A simple but more\nexpensive option would be to use paid tools such as Google AI Studio’s\nNano Banana, which created this image below in less than a minute.\nImagine the possibilities for the consumer here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image13.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Generative AI example for custom Cava label design&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The more complicated but cheaper option in the long run would be to use\ncustom tools such as ComfyUI below together with purchased CPU and GPU\nhardware, to do the image generation ourselves. In other words, the\nwineries would have to buy the computing equipment, and set up the\nbackend and frontend software tools for users to be able to easily enter\ntext for image generation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although this would be harder to set up, it would be cheaper after\ninitial capital costs are depreciated, due to the lower recurring cost\nnature vs the subscription and API fees for the paid tool options. There\nwould be more control over the entire end to end process as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./image9.webp&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;ComfyUI workflow interface for image generation&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Source: ComfyUI\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The premium price point of the product for this idea is required, due to\nthe higher effort and costs involved in producing the unique bottlings.\nSince we are targeting the high net worth customer segment, the\nincremental cost from the customisation is unlikely to impact demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Cava has much to look forward to in the next decade, despite the worrying trends overall for the wine market. There still remain many countries where sparkling wine and especially Spanish wine will be growth engines. Cava can further take advantage of canned wine, NOLO, and generative AI tools to appeal more to the modern consumer. It does not have to change its cultural history, but it does have to experiment with new marketing approaches to expect changes in growth for the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>\u003Ch2 style=\"display:inline\">References\u003C/h2>\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>The art of drinks.
