Some interesting excerpts from "Port and the Douro", by Richard Mayson. 

I found the book helpful in providing more context about the history of Port while preparing for the dipWSET fortified wine module. 

I personally do like the sweetness and fruity notes of Ports, but the high alcohol is challenging. It is also special to be drinking wines older than yourself.

> The story of Port and the Douro is inseparable from Portugal's emergence as a trading nation, in which England, another rapidly developing mercantile power, played a crucially important part.

The book discusses this Portugal England relationship, which played both a factor in Port growth and also subsequent decline.

> Hard as it is to imagine today, the steep terraced slopes of the Douro were then mainly producing cereals as well as sumagre (sumac), a plant used as a dyeing and tanning agent that can still be found growing wild all over the region.

> Most of the Ports shipped to England in the early years of the eighteenth century were dark and austere reds, fermented to dryness, earning them the name 'black-strap'. In a determined effort to make sure that the wines arrived at their destination in good condition, many merchants would add a generous measure of brandy probably raising the level of alcohol to around at least 15 or 16% by volume.

Port these days is typically around 20% ABV.

> [As of 1945] just 2 per cent of all Port was bottled in Oporto. The remainder continued to be shipped in cask and bottled at its destination

> The late bottled vintage (LBV) style evolved largely by default. In the lean years from the 1930s to the 1950s, it was not uncommon for a vintage Port to remain in wood for rather longer than normal while the wine was awaiting a buyer. Under the terms of subsequent legislation, many of these wines were technically 'late bottled'.

> Once a vintage Port has been bottled, it continues to develop and evolve over a period of fifteen to twenty years or more before it is considered as being ready to drink. Rather like the seven ages of man, vintage Port customarily enjoys a short, fragrant bloom of youth before it shuts down and endures ten, even fifteen years of surly, spotty adolescence. Then it slowly begins to emerge as a fully-fledged adult, gaining stature and gravitas until the Port reaches its peak, often at around twenty or thirty years of age. 

> Once a bottle has been opened, all Ports begin to deteriorate after a short period of time. Rubies and filtered LBVs begin to lose some of their freshness and vibrancy a week or so after opening and should be drunk within three weeks. Having matured for longer in cask, aged tawnies will stay in good condition for longer after opening: a month or two if kept in the refrigerator. Like all great wines, vintage Ports (along with crusted and bottle-matured LBVs) should be consumed within a few days of opening.

That said, I have tasted Port that I left around for months and it was still drinkable, though some of the fruit was muted.
