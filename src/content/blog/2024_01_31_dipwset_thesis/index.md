Interest in no and low alcohol wines (NOLO) has never been higher. This
\<11% alcohol by volume (ABV) category[^1] just hit a new peak in
worldwide Google searches (Google, 2023); it is also the trending topic
at major wine exhibitions (Carter, 2023).

With worldwide NOLO sales predicted to grow twice as fast as the overall
wine market, and this rapid growth expected across major wine consuming
countries, the race is on to secure first-mover advantage in a category
still in the introduction stage of its product life cycle (Fact.MR,
2022; Statista, 2023). High volume producers (e.g. Yellow Tail) and low
volume wineries (e.g. Barton Guestier) alike are experimenting with NOLO
as a new revenue stream (Frank, 2022).

In this paper we will explore:

1.  Why NOLO is growing fast, from a demand and supply perspective

2.  How NOLO is made, with resulting tradeoffs in quality and price

3.  Where NOLO can go, and my contrarian opinion on NOLO marketing

### From YOLO to NOLO

NOLO's growth can be attributed to (1) Decreased alcohol consumption due
to social and political factors, impacting *demand* (2) Improved NOLO
product quality driven by economic and technological factors,
influencing *supply*. The increased demand for NOLO attracts new supply,
in a reinforcing growth loop that has excited both consumers and
producers.

Alcohol consumption has declined in recent decades, particularly among
the younger generation (Loy et al., 2021). This shift has led some
consumers to substitute traditional alcoholic wines with NOLO
alternatives, as outlined in a World Health Organization (WHO) report
(World Health Organization, 2023). For example, "Dry January" started as
a discussion about having a temporary break from drinking[^2] (Alcohol
Change UK, 2023).

Research indicates that the decline in alcohol consumption has been a
global phenomenon for the past 50 years, and not country specific[^3]
(Our World in Data, 2017).

height="3.9027777777777777in"}

A 2022 study of Nordic and Mediterranean countries also showed mostly
declines in the proportion of adolescent drinkers (Rossow et al., 2022).

![Chart](media/media/image29.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.388888888888889in"}

A more extensive study in 2015 concurred, revealing a gradual decline in
alcohol use among both European and North American youth (Looze et al.,
2015).

![Chart](media/media/image26.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.486111111111111in"}

**Health is the main reason for this decline**. In a turnaround from the
"You Only Live Once (YOLO)" mentality of the past[^4], people today are
increasingly health conscious. Consumers are still worried about not
fully experiencing life, but are also concerned that their health might
prevent them from doing so, and changing what they consume as a result
(Texas Health, 2023). Across generations, people are increasing their
prioritisation of health (The New Consumer & Coefficient Capital, 2022).

![Chart](media/media/image25.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.263888888888889in"}

For example, \~35% of American consumers surveyed adopted new eating
patterns to "prevent future health conditions" (International Food
Information Council Foundation, 2018). The 2020 COVID pandemic also put
a spotlight on this social norm, with consumers being more observant of
their health as a result (NutriSystem, 2023).

Beyond the social aspect, politics have played a role in shaping
attitudes toward alcohol, by increasing awareness of its adverse health
effects. With the World Cancer Research Fund finding strong evidence
that alcohol consumption increases cancer risk[^5], and the WHO
estimating harmful alcohol usage represents 5% of the global disease
burden[^6], governing bodies such as the EU are considering stronger
alcohol regulations (World Cancer Research Fund, 2018; World Health
Organization, 2022).

These regulations are typically aimed at restricting and reducing
alcohol consumption (Looze et al., 2015; Goold et al., 2017). The
stronger the national alcohol policy, the lower the alcohol consumption
in that country (Brand et al., 2007). For example, over a period of 50
years Norwegians have reversed their attitude and become increasingly
supportive of alcohol control policies, due to increased awareness of
alcohol health risks (Rossow & Storvoll, 2013).

Because of these social and political factors, consumers are
reconsidering their relationship with wine, believing that reducing
alcohol consumption will decrease calorie intake, blood pressure, and
cancer risk (World Health Organization, 2023). Additionally, for women,
considerations related to pregnancy and nursing have driven them to
explore NOLO, as noted by Dawn Maire, founder of a NOLO startup (Reiley
et al., 2023).

For example, a 2017 study found that "health" was the main reason
participants decreased their wine consumption[^7] (Stockley et al.,
2017).

![Chart](media/media/image10.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.013888888888889in"}

These health-conscious consumers are choosing NOLO as a substitute for
traditional wine. A 2014 UK study found that the top reason for lower
alcohol purchases was "it's better for my health" (Bruwer et al., 2014).

![Chart](media/media/image24.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.4583333333333335in"}

A separate 2013 Australian study supported this, with \"health\" being
the second most common motivation for interest in NOLO (Saliba et al.,
2013).

![Chart](media/media/image22.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.6527777777777777in"}

However, these demand influences on NOLO would not have been fulfilled,
had product quality missed expectations. After all, NOLO is trending,
not grape juice. Economic and technological factors have increased the
supply of quality product offerings, past a tipping point of consumer
acceptance.

From an economic perspective, NOLO's high growth provides an attractive
new profit opportunity, with industry experts discussing how "there's
money to be made" for producers (Carter, 2023). Companies that
effectively target the younger demographic through enticing social
media, graphics, and packaging have experienced notable success (Beaton,
2022). For example, Boisson, a NOLO retailer, increased its revenue 300%
from 2021 to 2022, and recently raised venture funding from Pernod
Ricard[^8] (Business Wire, 2023).

From a technology perspective, NOLO quality has improved greatly over
the past 30 years. Historically, sweetness was used to compensate for
the lack of ethanol, with sugar levels \>40 g/L being common[^9] (Schulz
et al., 2023). However, the typical drinker associates sweetness with
lower quality cheap wine[^10], resulting in NOLO also being perceived as
low quality even before being tasted (Josselin et al., 2008).

![Chart](media/media/image1.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.8055555555555554in"}

Modern technology has changed this. Lower processing temperatures and
enhanced aroma adjustments have elevated product standards (Bucher et
al., 2020; Pickering, 2010). While we will discuss the production
process in detail in the next section, one such technique is the use of
linalool, geranial, and isoamyl acetate extracts to enrich floral and
fruity aromas in NOLO, where regulations are less strict than
traditional wine[^11] (Ma et al., 2022).

Today, NOLO wines are getting good reviews. For example, Wine
Spectator's review of Ariel Vineyards NOLO Chardonnay described it as
"balanced, with varietal-specific aromas and flavors" (Napjus, 2022). A
recent 2020 experiment also found no significant difference in how much
participants liked NOLO vs standard wine[^12] (Bucher et al., 2020).

![Chart](media/media/image28.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.8055555555555554in"}

**In summary, health has been the main demand driver for NOLO, with
profit opportunities and technology improvements the main supply
drivers**. Although there are secondary reasons such as the
affordability of lower taxed NOLO vs higher taxed traditional wine,
social influencer campaigns, or a 2018 change in US tax law on higher
alcohol wine driving alcohol driving alcohol reduction companies to seek
new customers, the country agnostic growth in NOLO is due to the primary
reasons above.

###  

### Reduce and reuse to make NOLO

Unlike "natural wine", NOLO requires massive human meddling. Instead of
"nothing added, nothing taken", NOLO opts for a "reduce and reuse"
approach. Extreme opposites in winemaking philosophies; yet both have
achieved success.

Whether red, white, rose, or sparkling, NOLO is typically made via two
primary methods, each with subcategories:

1.  Thermal distillation

    a.  Vacuum distillation

    b.  Spinning cone column

2.  Semi-permeable membrane

    a.  Reverse osmosis

    b.  Osmotic distillation

Thermal distillation processes require higher temperatures and cost more
than membrane processes. Within this method, vacuum distillation is a
common technique already used to adjust traditional wine alcohol levels
at many wineries (Motta et al., 2017). Inside a tank, wine is heated at
moderate temperatures (15-20C) under vacuum, which evaporates the
ethanol. The ethanol vapour rises to the top of the tank, condensing as
a distillate in a separate container, *reducing* the ABV of the tank's
liquid. Producers might opt to *reuse* volatile aromas from the
distillate by capturing and adding them back after distillation (Ma et
al., 2022).

![](media/media/image35.png){width="4.755208880139983in"
height="3.2950076552930883in"}

Vacuum distillation has a mixed effect on NOLO style and quality. It can
significantly reduce many desirable volatile compounds, such as esters,
higher alcohols, and terpenes. However, it can concentrate sugars and
colour intensity (Sam et al., 2021). It is also quicker to reach a low
final level of ABV.

![Chart](media/media/image6.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.013888888888889in"}

Spinning cone column (SCC) is a modification of the vacuum distillation
process that takes place in two stages to improve aroma retention. SCC
consists of a central vertical shaft with convex cones[^13], rotating
between other convex cones attached to the interior casing of the tank
(Schmidtke et al., 2012). In the first stage, low vacuum pressure and
moderate \~28C temperatures are used to recover desirable volatile
aromas. In the second stage, higher vacuum pressure and \~38C
temperatures are used to remove alcohol (Sam et al., 2021). The aromas
from the first stage are *reused* by combining with the *reduced*
alcohol liquid from the second stage, to create a product stylistically
more similar to regular wine, and of higher quality than vacuum
distillation.

In SCC, wine is pumped to the top of the tank, onto the 1st rotating
cone attached to the central shaft. The spinning results in centrifugal
force spraying a thin film of wine outwards onto the 1st fixed cone
attached to the tank[^14]. The liquid trickles down this 1st fixed cone
onto the 2nd rotating cone, and the process is repeated until it reaches
the bottom of the column. While this is happening, a "stripping
gas"[^15] is pumped in the bottom of the tank. As the gas rises to the
top, it picks up volatile aromas or ethanol through mass transfer. Fins
attached to the cones increase turbulence and hence effectiveness of the
process. This allows for both a *reduction* in alcohol, and a *reuse* of
aromas later on (Schmidtke et al., 2012).

![](media/media/image35.png){width="4.755208880139983in"
height="3.273953412073491in"}

SCC stands out for its ability to recover desirable aromas with both
high efficiency and minimal passes, leading to higher quality NOLO.
While it is favoured by producers for its quality outcomes, the downside
includes the substantial capital costs for equipment and the requirement
for specialised operational expertise, implying higher production
volumes are required to make it economical.

For example, BevZero, an alcohol reduction provider, quotes \$1-2mm
setup costs for SCC (Beverage Trade Network, 2023). Producers may
outsource this step to providers such as BevZero, similar to how some
sparkling winemakers delegate parts of the production process (BevZero,
2023; Oztruk & Anli, 2015). However, this may not be possible in
countries where expected production volumes are too low to justify
investment, such as Austria (Gentile et al., 2023).

Membrane processes typically require lower temperatures but more passes
than thermal processes. Reverse osmosis (RO) uses a hydrophilic
semi-permeable membrane under high pressure but low 1-5C temperatures.
High pressure on the side with a higher concentration solution causes a
reverse of the typical osmosis process, resulting in even higher
concentrations on that side. This filters out smaller ethanol and water
molecules from the base wine over multiple tangential passes through the
membrane. The ethanol and water mixture can be further separated through
distillation, allowing for *reuse* of the water in the process (Ma et
al., 2022).

![](media/media/image35.png){width="4.755208880139983in"
height="2.6041863517060366in"}

RO benefits include aroma retention due to the low operating
temperatures, lower capital and operating costs than thermal
distillation (therefore possibly lower prices), and being a "clean"
technology since the ethanol and water can be reused after extraction.
For example, it has a lower rate of higher alcohol and terpene loss
compared to vacuum distillation, implying a higher quality NOLO that is
stylistically more similar to regular wine (Sam et al., 2021).

RO drawbacks include the multiple passes required for the alcohol
reduction, recurring costs for membrane replacement, and legal
uncertainties regarding the re-addition of water in the production
process, since adding water to wine is banned in some countries (Ma et
al., 2022).

![Chart](media/media/image17.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.027777777777778in"}

Osmotic distillation[^16] (OD) also uses a membrane for alcohol
reduction. Differential vapour pressure on both sides of a hydrophobic
membrane causes ethanol to evaporate on one side, diffuse across the
membrane, and then condense on the other side with the help of a
"stripping gas"[^17] (Schmidtke et al., 2012).

![](media/media/image35.png){width="4.755208880139983in"
height="2.67209208223972in"}

Compared to RO, OD requires lower pressures and temperatures. However,
longer processing time is required. OD effect on style and quality is
uncertain, with conflicting studies citing minimal aroma compound loss
or adverse effects on volatile aromas, depending on the amount of
alcohol reduced (Ma et al., 2022; Schmidtke et al., 2012).

Other post fermentation options in NOLO production include
nanofiltration, pervaporation, or multistage systems that combine
multiple methods. However, these are not as widely used commercially due
to cost or lack of research, and we will not be discussing these further
(Ma et al., 2022; Schmidtke et al., 2012).

###  

### NOLO has ample room to grow

NOLO's current total market revenue of \$2bn is a fraction of the total
\$173bn wine market, implying future growth potential (Fact.MR, 2022;
Statista, 2023). Though there are some headwinds ahead, the tailwinds
for this category should continue to propel faster growth than the
overall wine market. In addition, I would like to propose an alternative
approach to NOLO marketing.

Climate change, costs of production, and consumer perception are the
three main headwinds to NOLO growth.

Climate change typically results in higher alcohol levels in wine, the
reverse of NOLO aims. Sunny winemaking regions have seen alcohol content
rise by \~2% ABV over the past 30 years due to the higher sugar
concentration at harvest (Goold et al., 2017).

The increased production costs associated with crafting NOLO from
quality base wine suggest the need for higher pricing. However, it
remains uncertain whether consumers are willing to pay *more* for a
product with *less* alcohol. A 2020 study indicated reduced consumer
willingness to pay for NOLO, supported by a NielsenIQ report revealing
an average US NOLO price of \$6.84 vs \$11.01 for traditional wine
(Bucher et al., 2020; NielsenIQ, 2023). In contrast, six of the top
eight best-selling NOLO products on Boisson are priced \>\$20, above the
typical cost of traditional wines[^18] (Boisson, 2023).

Consumer perception that NOLO products are inferior is also an obstacle.
Acceptance of NOLO varies by country, with people adjusting their
attitudes only when assured that taste quality would be the same (Saliba
et al., 2013).

![Chart](media/media/image21.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.861111111111111in"}

Producers have multiple options to mitigate the above risks. In the
vineyard, planting varieties that naturally make lower alcohol wines
(e.g. Furmint), harvesting earlier, or selecting sites of formerly
marginal areas benefiting from climate change (e.g. UK) could increase
NOLO production resilience (Frank, 2022).

In the winery, usage of glucose oxidase to reduce fermentable sugars or
new yeast strains selected for lower ethanol production[^19] could
reduce costs in the future. For instance, Athletic Brewing Co has
successfully prevented ethanol generation during fermentation for its
beers (Mazzeo, 2022). This remains a field of ongoing research due to
the complexity of yeast biology in quality wine production (Goold et
al., 2017; Schmidtke et al., 2012).

To change consumer perception, producers might consider partnering with
the public sector for additional marketing impact. Governments or public
health agencies could be open to promoting NOLO, if it helps reduce
overall alcohol consumption and improve health outcomes. Having
additional funding from other sources will help NOLO reach a larger top
of the funnel audience. For example, the UK Department of Health and
Social Care is committed to supporting the NOLO industry to increase
product availability by 2025 (Gov.UK, 2023).

Since NOLO is not subject to the same restrictions as wine, alternative
sales channels can also help with growth. For example, US regulations
technically consider the ethanol content destroyed after the NOLO
process, placing it under Food and Drug Administration rather than
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau jurisdiction. This makes it
possible to sell and offer tastings of NOLO in grocery stores, an
attractive marketing opportunity (Beverage Trade Network, 2023).

NOLO technology is likely to improve over time; health conscious
attitudes towards alcohol are unlikely to reverse in the short term.
Together with the options above, it is likely NOLO continues growing
faster than the traditional wine market.

**I also believe that current NOLO marketing is missing the point**.
Rather than harping on the association with wine, NOLO should
intentionally brand itself as a standalone category. Consumers do not
care that the product was originally made from wine or about the
technological breakthroughs behind it. Instead, they want something that
tastes good and makes them feel good about their lifestyle choices.

Here, NOLO can learn from sparkling and natural wine. Both fall under
the broader category of wine but are regarded as distinct products.
Consumers don\'t object to the effervescence in their Champagne or the
haziness in their natural wine; these characteristics are embraced
within their respective styles. Similarly, NOLO should offer a distinct
style rather than mimic wine. Transforming into a beverage that people
enjoy on its own will also alleviate the current challenges associated
with pairing NOLO with food.

Especially noteworthy is the potential rise of a sparkling NOLO product
promoted based on its inherent qualities, akin to the recent surge in
the hard seltzer market (Grand View Research, 2023). The effervescence
can enhance the perception of quality, mask potential faults, and
distinguish it from traditional wine. Given positive reviews for
sparkling NOLO products (e.g. Thomson & Scott Noughty), it\'s not
surprising that the majority of current NOLO offerings are of the
sparkling variety (Farrell, 2023; Gentile et al., 2023).

![Chart](media/media/image18.png){width="6.453125546806649in"
height="3.986111111111111in"}

A hundred years on from Prohibition, the Temperance movement has come
and gone, but perhaps a tempered temperance, NOLO movement is on the
rise. Health concerns have increased demand for NOLO, with technological
and economic factors improving supply.

As these trends mutually reinforce each other in a growth loop, I
anticipate sustained and even accelerated growth in the NOLO category.
Furthermore, I foresee the ascent of a sparkling NOLO product solely
driven by its exceptional taste, breaking free from the limitations of
being solely a wine derivative, and evolving to a formidable standalone
brand.

## Appendix 2 - Definition of no and low alcohol wine (NOLO)

Similar to "natural wine", there is no standard definition for NOLO. A
0.7% ABV wine may be classified as "low alcohol" in the UK, but
"non-alcoholic" in China, due to varying regulations (Anderson et al.,
2021; Sam et al., 2021)

In this paper we will adopt the International Organisation of Vine and
Wine (OIV) thresholds of \<0.5% ABV for no alcohol wine (OIV, 2012).

We will adopt \>=0.5% ABV for low alcohol wine, up to the typical ABV of
that wine style (typically \~11% ABV at a minimum, though this varies by
wine style) in cases where the alcohol reduction is \>20% (OIV, 2012).

We will only include wine where alcohol has been reduced
post-fermentation to be intentionally marketed as NOLO. Therefore, we
are excluding wines such as sweet Riesling, Moscato d'Asti, or
California wines with reduced alcohol for tax reasons (BevZero, 2023).

We are also excluding non alcoholic products that have never been
through the fermentation process, such as grape juice or herbal
infusions.

An interesting side note is that reducing alcohol for tax reasons was a
primary driver of business for alcohol reduction service providers such
as BevZero, who had to diversify their income stream after a change in
US tax law on higher alcohol wines resulted in less demand for alcohol
reduction services.

~~No and low alcohol wines (NOLO)~~[^20] ~~are trending, with search
interest for these \<11% ABV categories at an all-time high (Google,
2023).~~

![Chart](media/media/image27.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.3472222222222223in"}

~~This is not just passive interest; consumers are putting money where
their mouth is. Worldwide NOLO sales are predicted to grow 10% annually
(Fact.MR, 2022), double the 5% growth rate of the overall wine market
(Statista, 2023). Neither is this a US-only trend, with countries like
Germany and Japan also expected to have high \~9% growth~~[^21]
~~(Fact.MR, 2022).~~

~~As a result, both high volume producers such as Yellow Tail and low
volume wineries such as Barton Guestier are experimenting with NOLO
wines of their own, hoping to capture market share early in a category
still in the introduction stage of its product life cycle (Frank,
2022)~~

~~In this paper I will explore:~~

1.  ~~Why NOLO is growing faster than average~~

2.  ~~How NOLO wine is made, and the tradeoffs in style, quality,
    price~~

3.  ~~Where NOLO can go, and my contrarian view on NOLO marketing~~

~~I will also include comparisons with "natural wine" and sparkling
wine~~[^22]~~, to provide a contrast in various approaches to
winemaking.~~

### ~~Reasons for the growth of NOLO~~

~~Three main factors are contributing to the rise of NOLO:~~

1.  ~~Socially, people are increasingly health conscious~~

2.  ~~Socially, consumers are drinking less alcohol overall,
    particularly the youth and women~~

3.  ~~Technological improvements have significantly improved NOLO
    quality~~

~~Alcohol today is typically thought of as having a negative impact on
health. The World Health Organization estimates harmful alcohol usage
represents 5% of the global disease burden~~[^23] ~~(World Health
Organization, 2022). The World Cancer Research Fund finds strong
evidence alcohol consumption increases the risk of mouth, oesophagus,
and breast cancer (World Cancer Research Fund, 2018).~~

~~As a result, despite the potential health benefits of wine such as the
increased lifespan "French Paradox" (Bucher et al., 2019), public policy
aims to restrict and reduce alcohol consumption overall (Looze et al.,
2015; Goold et al., 2017). The stronger the national alcohol policy, the
lower the alcohol consumption in that country (Brand et al., 2007). For
example, over a period of 50 years Norwegians have reversed their
attitude to become increasingly supportive of alcohol control policies,
due to increased awareness of alcohol related health issues (Rossow &
Storvoll, 2013).~~

~~Simultaneously, consumers are increasingly health conscious, diet
included. Reasons for this range from being worried about "experiencing
everything they'd like to do in life" to being ashamed of unhealthy
lifestyles (Texas Health, 2023). \~35% of consumers in a Food Insight
survey reported adopting an eating pattern to protect their long term
health (International Food Information Council Foundation, 2018). The
health-conscious trend was further heightened by the COVID pandemic,
with 71% of Americans being more observant of their health as a result
(NutriSystem, 2023).~~

~~In the context of this negative view of alcohol and government
intervention, the growing health awareness trend has consumers
reassessing their relationship with alcohol, wine included. A 2017 paper
found that "health" was the main reason participants decreased their
wine consumption~~[^24] ~~(Stockley et al., 2017). Consumers perceive
reducing alcohol consumption will decrease calorie intake, blood
pressure, and cancer risk (World Health Organization, 2023).~~

![Chart](media/media/image11.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.013888888888889in"}

~~These increasingly health-conscious consumers are choosing NOLO as a
substitute for traditional wine. In a 2014 UK study, the primary reason
for purchasing lower-alcohol wine was "it's better for my health"
(Bruwer et al., 2014).~~

![Chart](media/media/image5.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.4583333333333335in"}

~~This finding was corroborated by a parallel 2013 Australian study,
where "health" ranked as the second most common motivation for the
interest in low alcohol wines (Saliba et al., 2013). **Increased health
consciousness is the first factor in the increased interest in NOLO.**~~

![Chart](media/media/image7.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.6527777777777777in"}

~~A connected yet distinct trend driving NOLO growth is the gradual
decrease in alcohol consumption across the general populace,
particularly the younger generation and women. For example, "Dry
January" started in 2013 as a discussion about having a temporary break
from drinking~~[^25] ~~(Alcohol Change UK, 2023).~~

~~Numerous studies indicate a decrease in alcohol consumption among
adolescents in recent decades (Loy et al., 2021), such as a 2022 study
of adolescent drinking in Nordic and Mediterranean countries showing
that most of countries saw a decline in both consumption volume and
heavy episodic drinking (Rossow et al., 2022).~~

![Chart](media/media/image9.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.388888888888889in"}

~~Similarly, a larger international study found a gradual decrease in
youth weekly alcohol use in Europe and North America (Looze et al.,
2015).~~

![Chart](media/media/image8.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.486111111111111in"}

~~The decline in alcohol consumption among the younger generation has
sparked a rising demand for NOLO options. A 2012 Prowein survey
indicated a preference for 5.5-8% ABV among the 18-39 age groups in
China and a preference for \<10.5% ABV in Britain (Lechmere, 2012).~~

~~Simultaneously, there has been a decrease in alcohol consumption
overall among women. Women make up 60-80% of all wine purchases (Forbes
et al., 2010), and women aged 18-25 drink more alcohol than men (Han et
al., 2020). Hence, "a deepened understanding of the female segment
\[\...\] is therefore of great importance to better inform marketing
strategies", as concluded in a 2011 study on wine marketing (Bruwer et
al., 2011). And women are more interested in NOLO than ever.~~

~~For example, a 2013 Australian study cited how women were the most
likely demographic to purchase low alcohol wine (Saliba et al., 2013). A
2014 UK study included "females" as one of the top consumer segments for
low alcohol wines (Bucher et al., 2019). And a 2012 survey commissioned
by Prowien found Chinese women "more likely to say their preferred level
of alcohol \[for wine\] was 5.5-8%" (Lechmere, 2012).~~

~~This desire for lower alcohol options by women has manifested in
actual NOLO sales. Dawn Maire, founder of a NOLO startup, cited how
factors such as pregnancy, nursing, or health considerations have
prompted women to seek non-alcoholic alternatives (Reiley et al., 2023).
**The decline in overall alcohol consumption among the younger
generation and women is the second factor for NOLO growth.**~~

~~However, the rise in health consciousness and the decline in overall
alcohol consumption would not be helpful for NOLO, should the taste not
meet expectations. After all, NOLO, not grape juice, is trending. The
third factor for NOLO growth is technological innovation in the last 30
years improving product quality past a tipping point of consumer
acceptance (Schmidtke et al., 2012).~~

~~Historically, sweetness was used to compensate for reduced alcohol
content, with sugar levels \>40g/L being common in dealcoholized wines
to mimic the mouthfeel of ethanol (Reiley et al., 2023; Schulz et al.,
2023). However, the typical drinker associates sweetness with lower
quality cheap wine~~[^26]~~, and NOLO was perceived as "unripe, with
lighter fruit flavours, higher acid and harsher tannins" (King et al.,
2013)~~

~~Modern technology has significantly improved NOLO quality, with
advancements such as lower temperatures, enhanced aroma preservation,
and precise flavour adjustments contributing to positive consumer
perceptions (Bucher et al., 2020; Pickering, 2010). Extracts like rose,
peach, and lily have been employed to enrich fruity and floral aromas in
dealcoholized wines, utilising aroma compounds like linalool, geranial,
and isoamyl acetate~~[^27] ~~(Ma et al., 2022). NOLO wines are getting
good reviews today.~~

~~For example, a wine spectator review of Ariel Vineyards NOLO
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon described them as "balanced, with
varietal-specific aromas and flavors" (Napjus, 2022). A recent 2020
experiment also found that there was no significant difference in how
much participants liked low alcohol wine vs standard wine, regardless of
whether they were in a blinded experiment setup or not (Bucher et al.,
2020). **The improvement in taste of NOLO due to technology is the third
factor for its recent growth.**~~

![Chart](media/media/image20.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.8055555555555554in"}

~~To recap, the three main factors driving NOLO are the social factors
of increased health consciousness, lower alcohol consumption by youth
and women, and the technological factor of improved quality. While there
are secondary factors such as the affordability of NOLO vs higher taxed
standard options, social influencer campaigns, or the 2018 change in US
tax law on higher alcohol wine driving alcohol reduction companies to
seek new customers (Reiley et al., 2023), the worldwide, country
agnostic growth in NOLO is likely due to the major factors above.~~

### ~~How NOLO wine is made~~ 

~~Unlike "natural wine", NOLO requires massive human meddling. Instead
of "nothing added, nothing taken", NOLO opts for a "reduce and reuse"
approach elaborated on below. Extreme opposites in winemaking
philosophies; yet both have achieved success.~~

~~The primary methods of NOLO production post-fermentation are (Ma et
al., 2022):~~

1.  ~~Thermal distillation~~

    a.  ~~Vacuum distillation~~

    b.  ~~Spinning cone column~~

2.  ~~Semi-permeable membrane~~

    a.  ~~Reverse osmosis~~

    b.  ~~Osmotic distillation~~

    c.  ~~Pervaporation~~

~~Vacuum distillation is a common technique used in correction of wine
alcohol; many wineries are already set up for it (Motta et al., 2017).
Inside a tank, wine is heated at low temperatures (15-20C) under vacuum,
vaporising the ethanol. The ethanol rises to the top of the tank,
condensing as a distillate in a separate container. It is possible to
*reuse* some volatile aromas from this distillate, adding them back to
the *reduced* alcohol wine (Ma et al., 2022).~~

~~The vacuum distillation process has a mixed effect on NOLO style and
quality. It can concentrate non volatile compounds, increasing total
acidity, colour intensity, and sugar. However, it can significantly
reduce many desirable volatile compounds, such as esters, higher
alcohols, and terpenes (Sam et al., 2021).~~

~~Spinning cone column (SCC) consists of a central vertical shaft with
convex~~[^28] ~~cones, rotating between other convex cones attached to
the interior casing of the machine (Schmidtke et al., 2012). The process
typically requires two passes, with the first stage using low vacuum
pressure and moderate \~28C temperature to recover volatile wine
aromas~~[^29]~~, and the second stage using higher vacuum pressure and
\~38C temperature to dealcoholise the wine (Sam et al., 2021). The
dealcoholised wine is combined with the recovered wine aromas from the
first stage (BevZero, 2023), creating a product more stylistically
similar to regular wine, and of higher quality than vacuum
distillation.~~

~~In SCC, the wine to be treated is pumped to the top of the column,
onto the 1st rotating cone on the central shaft. The rotation of the
cone results in centrifugal force~~[^30] ~~acting on the wine liquid,
spraying a thin film of wine outwards onto the interior casing of fixed
cones. The liquid trickles down this 1st fixed cone, falling to the 2nd
rotating cone. This process is repeated at each cone, until the wine
reaches the bottom of the column (Schmidtke et al., 2012).~~

~~A "stripping gas"~~[^31] ~~is pumped in the bottom of the column,
picking up components such as volatile aromas and ethanol from mass
transfer as it rises to the top. This allows for both a *reduction* in
alcohol, and a possible *reuse* of the aromas (Schmidtke et al.,
2012).~~

~~SCC produces better quality NOLO due to the recovery of desirable
aromas, and also has fast processing times. The main drawback is the
high capital and operational costs (Schmidtke et al., 2012); BevZero, a
major dealcoholization service provider, quotes \$1-2mm setup costs
(Beverage Trade Network, 2023).~~

~~Reverse osmosis (RO) uses a hydrophilic semi-permeable membrane under
high pressure (Sam et al., 2021), to filter out smaller ethanol and
water molecules from the base wine. The ethanol and water solution is
then separated by distillation, and the water is added back to the
remaining base wine, which is now lower in alcohol (Schmidtke et al.,
2012). Here again there is a *reduction* in alcohol, the *reuse* of
water, and also the possibility of the separated ethanol being *reused*
elsewhere.~~

~~RO's benefits are that it can operate at low 1-5C temperatures for
aroma retention, has lower operating costs than thermal distillation
(Schmidtke et al., 2012), and is a "clean" technology due to the reuse
of process inputs (Sam et al., 2021). This results in higher quality
NOLO that is more stylistically similar to regular wine. For example, a
study found that RO retained more volatile fruity and floral notes,
compared to vacuum distillation (Sam et al., 2021). RO's drawbacks are
the high capital costs (Schmidtke et al., 2012), energy usage in
maintaining the high pressure, and possible restrictions in countries
due to laws regarding addition of water to wine (Ma et al., 2022).~~

~~Osmotic distillation~~[^32] ~~(OD) uses differential vapour pressure
across a hydrophobic membrane to remove alcohol. Ethanol evaporates from
the base wine container on one side, diffuses across the membrane, and
condenses on the other side with the help of a "stripping gas"~~
[^33]~~. The remaining wine has reduced alcohol.~~

~~OD operates at 10-20C temperatures, consuming less energy than thermal
distillation. This moderate temperature also allows less loss of aroma
and flavour (Sam et al., 2021). For example, a 2019 study found colour
and taste "remained almost unchanged" in NOLO made by OD (Corona et al.,
2019). However, longer processing time is required compared to RO
(Schmidtke et al., 2012).~~

Pervaporation is similar to osmotic distillation, but uses a different
type of membrane and gas[^34] (Schmidtke et al., 2012). Based on
chemical affinity, compounds are absorbed by the membrane, diffusing
across the membrane because of the differential concentration gradient,
and are desorbed on the other side of the membrane with the help of the
gas (Sam et al., 2021). Pervaporation can be highly selective, cause
less loss of aromatics, and is more environmentally friendly. However,
the high costs and lengthier process time have made it less commercially
popular (Ma et al., 2022).

~~Other post fermentation options in NOLO production include
nanofiltration (Schmidtke et al., 2012), evaporation (Bucher et al.,
2019), or multistage systems involving combinations of the above methods
(Ma et al., 2022). However, these are not as widely used and will not be
discussed further.~~

~~Each NOLO production method has different effects on style and hence
quality, as seen in the table below. All of these will add to costs,
therefore typically adding to price. Where capital costs are high,
producers might outsource the dealcoholisation to specialists such as
BevZero. The parallel with sparkling wine production is also interesting
to note. Both have high capital costs, and require base wines of good
quality due to the concentration of flavours.~~

### ~~Where can NOLO go~~

~~NOLO total market revenue is \~\$2bn (Fact.MR, 2022), compared to
wine's revenue of \~\$173bn (Statista, 2023). From this perspective,
NOLO has huge room for growth.~~

~~Technology should continue improving as the NOLO market grows,
reinforcing the growth loop. While social factors are unpredictable, it
seems unlikely that a sharp reversal in alcohol attitudes or health
consciousness will happen soon. Based on the main factors currently
driving NOLO, I expect it to continue growing faster than the overall
wine market.~~

~~Headwinds in the face of this growth include climate change, costs,
and consumer perception.~~

~~Climate change typically results in higher alcohol levels, the
opposite of NOLO goals. Higher heat and sunlight results in higher grape
sugar content at harvest and higher ABV. For example, sunny regions have
seen alcohol content rise by \~2% ABV over the past 30 years (Goold et
al., 2017).~~

~~The high costs of NOLO production also imply a higher price should be
charged; NOLO involves starting with a finished wine and then adding
additional processing. Yet, consumers currently are willing to pay more
for regular wine than NOLO (Bucher et al., 2020), which could make NOLO
profit margins thin.~~

~~Consumer perception that NOLO products are inferior is another barrier
to growth (Schmidtke et al., 2012). Countries such as the UK and Germany
might be more accepting, but there is still a long way to go worldwide
(Bruwer et al., 2011). This also hinders the ability to increase
prices.~~

~~NOLO producers have multiple options to mitigate the above risks. In
the vineyard, planting varieties such as Furmint that naturally make
lower alcohol wines could be the next grape growing trend (Frank, 2022).
Marginal wine making areas that are now benefiting from climate change,
for instance the UK, could focus on naturally NOLO wine production.
Fruit could be harvested earlier, juice diluted, or glucose oxidase used
to reduce fermentable sugar (Schmidtke et al., 2012).~~

~~In the winery, carbonic maceration is an option to reduce alcohol by
\~4% (Gutierrez et al., 2023). Researchers are also experimenting with
new or genetically modified yeast strains to make NOLO (Schmidtke et
al., 2012). However, this is complicated, and "trying to produce better
'balanced' fruity wines from well-ripened grapes is much more complex
than initially assumed" (Goold et al., 2017).~~

~~To change consumer perception, NOLO producers might partner with the
public sector. Governmental agencies or public health organisations
could be interested in promoting NOLO as a healthier alternative to
alcohol. For example, campaigns promoting NOLO during "Dry January" or
high profile awards for NOLO brands might raise the sector's public
profile (Bruwer et al., 2011).~~

~~NOLO is also not subject to the same restrictions as regular wine
(World Health Organization, 2023), a possible marketing opportunity. For
example, USA NOLO production technically "destroys" wine content,
placing NOLO under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rather than
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) jurisdiction. Hence, it
is permissible to sell NOLO in grocery stores (Beverage Trade Network,
2023), a tailwind for growth.~~

~~More importantly, **I believe current NOLO marketing is fundamentally
flawed**. In this paper, I've compared styles and qualities of NOLO vs
regular wine, but NOLO should transcend those comparisons and become its
own breakout category. Sparkling wine is by definition a wine, and yet
nobody considers Champagne as a possible wine alternative when eating a
steak. "Natural wine" is also a type of wine, but has such ambiguous
definitions that most people also evaluate it on a standalone basis.
Similarly, marketers should stop associating NOLO as "wine but modified"
and instead as a category in and of itself. Stop trying to be similar to
wine, and be different intentionally.~~

~~Additionally, focusing more on sparkling NOLO production could help
drive faster growth. Sparkling wine is only \~30% of the NOLO market
(Fact.MR, 2022), despite the bubbles being able to help improve quality
perception and mask potential issues in NOLO. For example, taste testers
were impressed by Thomson & Scott Noughty, a NOLO sparkling Chardonnay
(Farrell, 2023). Perhaps the rapid growth of the hard seltzer market
(Grand View Research, 2023) could provide lessons for NOLO marketers.~~

~~NOLO has grown due to social health trends and technological
improvements, of which the main ones have been discussed in this paper.
I expect the category to continue growing, and even accelerating, as
these trends continue to reinforce each other, and am betting on a
sparkling NOLO to lead the race here.~~

Interest in the low- and no-alcohol 'wine' category has increased in
recent years. Whereas wine has minimum legal requirements for abv.,
products in the low- and no- category are technically 'wine-based
products' that have had the alcohol reduced or removed following the
alcoholic fermentation, and there are different methods of accomplishing
this. Although this is undeniably a developing category, it remains to
be seen what the future Holds

2.  [~~economic, health and quality issues (Fig. 2). First, there are
    countries that apply financial imposts on wine with a 'high' alcohol
    concentration. This increases the end cost of the wine to the
    purchaser and the consumer in those countries. Second, in today\'s
    increasingly health- and safety-conscious society, wines with high
    alcohol concentration attract constant negative commentary from
    health professionals, lawmakers, media, anti-alcohol advocacy groups
    and politicians. The harmful effects of excessive alcohol
    consumption on communities and the concomitant burden on health
    care, law enforcement services and economic productivity have been
    widely reported. Third, too much alcohol in wine can negatively
    affect the sensory properties of a wine. Although many wines with
    higher alcohol concentration are full-bodied and rich in ripe fruit
    flavours, in some cases and depending on wine style, too high a
    concentration of alcohol can be perceived as a 'hotness' on the
    palate, making overly alcoholic wines appear unbalanced. In terms of
    overall wine quality, balance between alcohol strength, acidity,
    tannin, sweetness and fruit flavour intensity is extremely
    important.
    https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1751-7915.12488~~]{.mark}

3.  [~~In the field of wine, the de-alcoholisation research has two
    directions: one objective is to decrease the alcohol strength in
    wine, and the second is to produce new low-alcohol beverages
    \[[**28**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B28-nutrients-13-03153)\].
    With regard to the first objective, the main issue that the wine
    industry faces is the increase in wine ABV due to climate change
    conditions (e.g., in Australian red wines, alcohol concentration has
    increased approximately 1% ABV per decade since the 1980s
    \[[**29**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B29-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
    Thus, research has focused on how to reduce the elevated alcohol
    content in wine without leading to a taste that is not as
    well-accepted by consumers (e.g.,
    \[[**29**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B29-nutrients-13-03153),[**30**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B30-nutrients-13-03153),[**31**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B31-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
    For the second objective, the issue is also to overcome the loss of
    desirable sensory properties appreciated by consumers when alcohol
    content is reduced/removed from wine, with research focusing on
    identifying the most appropriate methods to achieve this goal (e.g.,
    \[[**32**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B32-nutrients-13-03153),[**33**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B33-nutrients-13-03153),[**34**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B34-nutrients-13-03153),[**35**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B35-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
    In terms of the definition of lower-alcohol wine products, the
    reviews have acknowledged country differences in regulations: one
    review mentioned the definitions adopted by the International
    Organisation of Vine and Wine: 'Beverages obtained by wine
    dealcoholization' for beverages with 0.5% ABV or lower, and
    'Beverages obtained by partial wine dealcoholization' for those in
    the range of 0.5--8.5% ABV
    \[[**28**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B28-nutrients-13-03153)\];
    other reviews have defined wine products as lower-alcohol with an
    ABV of up to 11.0%
    \[[**33**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B33-nutrients-13-03153),[**34**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B34-nutrients-13-03153)\].

    i.  Although economic factors are important in many long-wave
        changes in behaviour, the timing and consistency of the recent
        changes in youth drinking behaviour, across societies with
        differing economic trajectories, suggest that economic factors
        are not an important part of the explanation -- as has also been
        argued concerning the previous "long waves" of alcohol
        consumption in the 19th and 20th centuries (Mäkelä et al. 1981).
        Secular changes in the realm of habitus -- of social
        presentation and interaction \-- and in particular changes in
        the intergenerational relations and interactions in family life,
        may well figure in the changes in youth drinking, as argued by
        Kraus et al. (2019). But the evidence is not strong on how
        widespread such changes may be. As a factor with broad effects
        on behaviour which is widely dispersed across societies, the
        advent and broad impact on daily life in all high-income
        countries of the worldwide web points to it as a leading factor
        in the widespread decline in youth alcohol consumption.

13. SCC process efficiency is improved from a few factors. Firstly, the
    thinness of the liquid due to the rotational force increases the
    surface area of exposure. Secondly, the multiple cones setup
    increases the number of chances the gas interacts with the volatile
    components, or the contact rate. Thirdly, the addition of "fins" to
    the bottom of the rotating cones further increases the agitation of
    both gas and liquid in the device, also increasing contact rate for
    more mass transfer.
    [[https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02448.x]{.underline}](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02448.x).

14. ~~Between each pair of cones, there is a fixed inverted cone,
    attached to the casing of the column (Figure 8). The liquid feed is
    fed to the top of the column into the 1st spinning cone. A film of
    liquid is flung outwards by centrifugal action onto the inside
    surface of the casing. The liquid will then drop onto a fixed cone
    and migrate as a thin film downwards and toward the center of the
    cone under the influence of gravity. The liquid then passes onto the
    2nd spinning cone, and the movement is repeated several times until
    the liquid reaches the bottom of the column.

16. ~~There are two basic ways to remove the alcohol content of wine:
    membrane-based processes and vacuum distillation. The former include
    techniques such as reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, pervaporation,
    and osmotic distillation. A comprehensive overview of the individual
    procedures is provided by Zamora \[11\]. As Schmitt and Christmann
    \[33\] showed, membrane processes can be particularly suitable for
    partial dealcoholization. https://www.mdpi.com/2674-0311/2/3/20~~

17. ~~However, full dealcoholization is associated with high energy and
    resource consumption, which is why technologies such as reverse
    osmosis are rarely used for this purpose. In Germany, thermal
    processes in the form of vacuum distillation have become the most
    popular method to produce non-alcoholic wine, e.g., by vacuum
    rectification or spinning cone column

21. ~~Additionally, the operational costs related to these techniques
    are relatively high. Moreover, reduced-alcohol or alcohol-free wines
    and beverages may be susceptible to microbial contamination and
    should be produced under aseptic conditions. Despite these
    challenges, many commercial reduced alcoholic strength products have
    been produced and marketed successfully. Moreover, the combination
    of some of the techniques as well as reconstitution (aroma
    enhancement) after dealcoholization may provide a good alternative
    for balancing production costs and the sensory profile of
    reduced-alcohol or alcohol-free wines and beverages.

22. ~~(post-fermentation stage) of wine since these methods are mostly
    preferred to those used at pre-fermentation and concurrent
    fermentation stages of wine due to their ability to achieve best
    results, thus, produce low and nonalcoholic wines with high
    concentration of fermentative aroma compounds resulting from fully
    fermented juice
    [[https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/82466]{.underline}](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/82466)~~

23. ~~Reverse osmosis The separation of 2 solutions of unequal solute
    concentration by a semi-permeable membrane establishes a
    concentration or pressure gradient between them known as osmotic
    pressure. In such a system, water will move by a process of osmosis
    from the solution of low concentration across the membrane in order
    to restore equilibrium. However, if sufficient pressure (greater
    than the osmotic pressure) is applied on the high concentration
    side, solvent can move out of this solution across the membrane to
    the low concentration solution, in a phenomenon known as reverse
    osmosis. Effectively, the concentration of the dilute solution
    reduces while that of the concentrated solution increases.~~

    a.  From the explanation outlined above, it should be easy to see
        how this phenomenon could be exploited as a filtration process.
        In fact, simply adjusting the pore size of the membrane material
        and the applied pressure give rise to a spectrum of membrane
        filtration processes with increasing solute permeability (and
        reducing operating pressure) such as reverse osmosis,
        nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration,
        respectively ([[Figure
        4]{.underline}](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02448.x#f4)).
        Thus, not only water or substances with comparably low molecular
        weight may pass through the membrane as in reverse osmosis but
        other solutes and solvents in gradation of size and molecular
        weights.

    e.  During membrane processing, the feed is separated into 2
        streams: retentate (concentrate) and permeate (filtrate). The
        volumetric throughput of the membrane surface per hour, per
        meter square (L h−1 m−2) is called the flux and is dependent on
        the applied pressure and total membrane resistance. The membrane
        resistance is a composite of factors that limit permeation such
        as viscosity of permeate, pore size, extent of fouling, and
        interactions between membrane material and feed. The larger the
        membrane area, the greater the filtration capacity.

    d.  ~~However, in sunny, warmer regions, the average alcohol content
        has risen by approximately 2% (v/v) over the past 30 years or
        so. Where it used to be rare to encounter wines with alcohol
        concentrations of more than 14% (v/v) before the 1980s, it is
        now not uncommon to see wines with an alcohol concentration of
        higher than 16% (v/v) (Varela et al., 2015).
        [[https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1751-7915.12488]{.underline}](https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1751-7915.12488)~~

    e.  [~~ith regard to the first objective, the main issue that the
        wine industry faces is the increase in wine ABV due to climate
        change conditions (e.g., in Australian red wines, alcohol
        concentration has increased approximately 1% ABV per decade
        since the 1980s
        \[[**29**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B29-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
        Thus, research has focused on how to reduce the elevated alcohol
        content in wine without leading to a taste that is not as
        well-accepted by consumers (e.g.,
        \[[**29**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B29-nutrients-13-03153),[**30**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B30-nutrients-13-03153),[**31**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B31-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
        For the second objective, the issue is also to overcome the loss
        of desirable sensory properties appreciated by consumers when
        alcohol content is reduced/removed from wine, with research
        focusing on identifying the most appropriate methods to achieve
        this goal (e.g.,
        \[[**32**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B32-nutrients-13-03153),[**33**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B33-nutrients-13-03153),[**34**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B34-nutrients-13-03153),[**35**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B35-nutrients-13-03153)\]).
        In terms of the definition of lower-alcohol wine products, the
        reviews have acknowledged country differences in regulations:
        one review mentioned the definitions adopted by the
        International Organisation of Vine and Wine: 'Beverages obtained
        by wine dealcoholization' for beverages with 0.5% ABV or lower,
        and 'Beverages obtained by partial wine dealcoholization' for
        those in the range of 0.5--8.5% ABV
        \[[**28**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B28-nutrients-13-03153)\];
        other reviews have defined wine products as lower-alcohol with
        an ABV of up to 11.0%
        \[[**33**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B33-nutrients-13-03153),[**34**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/9/3153#B34-nutrients-13-03153)\].

        the metabolism of yeast cells is upset and that results in
        high-glycerol/low-ethanol wine with unacceptable concentrations
        of other metabolites that have an unfavourable impact on the
        overall sensory quality of the wine.

- ~~In 2021, the volume of no- or low-alcohol beverages grew by 31
  percent year-over-year, according to a 2022 report by IWSR Drinks
  Market Analysis. Across the United States, the non-alcoholic market
  accounts for over \$414 million in sales, according to data analytics
  firm Statista, and the market is expected to expand by over five
  percent per year from 2021 through 2026 as consumers continue to gain
  interest in functional wellness beverages.~~

- Major metropolitan areas lead in NA sales on Drizly. The top markets
  that over-index on non-alcoholic sales include Boston, Denver,
  northern New Jersey, Brooklyn, and Washington, D.C.

- ~~"In the past year, the most popular month for sales across
  non-alcoholic categories was January as a result of the dry January
  movement," says Liz Paquette, Drizly's head of consumer insights.
  "Retailers should consider non-alcoholic categories as a key part of
  their stocking strategy and keep a close eye on innovation as more and
  more products hit the market and consumer awareness grows."~~

- ~~According to NielsenIQ, for the 52-week period ending September 18,
  2021, the total NOLO category grew to \$3.1 billion in the off-premise
  channel, with a growth rate of 10.4 percent compared to just 2.2
  percent for the alcohol category as a whole. The \$331 million
  no-alcohol sub-category is growing even more rapidly---33.2 percent
  for the same period (incl beers)~~

- ~~Powerhouse brands such as Yellow Tail, Kendall-Jackson, and Kim
  Crawford all launched lower-alcohol lines last year. Recent wineries
  entering the non-alcoholic wine space include Miller Family Wine Co.
  (with Hand on Heart), Veuve du Vernay, Barton & Guestier, and Stella
  Rosa, while New Zealand's Giesen is expanding their successful
  alcohol-removed 0% line beyond Sauvignon Blanc, introducing a red,
  rosé, and Pinot Gris in the next several months.~~

- ~~While there's increasing interest in purposefully made low-alcohol
  wines, there are plenty of existing wine styles that can fit the bill.
  "We don't ever market this as a category per se," explains Harmon
  Skurnik, the president of Skurnik Wines & Spirits, "but we do have a
  lot more wines in our book that are under 13% ABV---even some that are
  10% or 11%, and of course there have always been the German Spätleses
  that come in at 8%.~~"

- 

- ~~Once-obscure styles such as dry Muscat, Silvaner, and pét-nat are
  joining naturally low-alcohol mainstays like Vinho Verde and Moscato
  d'Asti. Sariya Jarasviroj Brown, the founder of Arizona-based importer
  Circo Vino, highlights Furmint and St. Laurent as grape varieties that
  can easily make lower alcohol wines.~~

- ~~Between August 2021 and August 2022, total dollar sales of
  nonalcoholic wine, beer, cider and spirits in the United States grew
  more than 20 percent, according to NielsenIQ. Fact.MR, a market
  research firm, projects that sales of nonalcoholic wine will double by
  2033 as people seek to reduce their alcohol consumption and
  manufacturers improve the taste and branding to give it the gloss of a
  premium, high-quality product.~~

- ~~But in 2018 the federal tax law changed, and wines could all of a
  sudden be 16 percent alcohol without incurring higher taxes. BevZero
  and other alcohol-reduction companies lost customers.~~

- ~~"There was no longer a big need for alcohol-reduction services, and
  we lost 25 to 30 percent of our business," said Matt Hughes, BevZero
  general manager. "So we started asking, 'well, how low can we go
  \[with the alcohol\]?'"~~

- ~~And it was right around that time that the "sober curious" movement
  took off. BevZero and companies like it found a slightly new line of
  work.~~

- ~~Within the evaluations 'liking of the new wine' and 'pleasantness to
  drink the wine', there were no significant differences in mean values
  between participants in the low-alcohol condition and the other two
  conditions, that is, control condition (standard wine) and low-alcohol
  blind condition. Both wines (low-alcohol wine and standard wine)
  received high ratings. These positive perceptions of low-alcohol wine
  support the assumption that production methods have improved within
  the last years, resulting in low-alcohol wine with good sensory
  qualities. It should be noted that the acceptance of low-alcohol wine
  may differ between countries.~~

- ~~A study by d'Hauteville(26), for example, found that people from the
  UK (26·7 %) were more willing to accept the concept of low-alcohol
  wine compared with people from Germany (19·5 %) or France (12·4 %).
  One possible explanation for this may be that other low-alcohol
  beverages, such as low-alcohol beer, have been well established yet in
  countries like the UK(27), whereas lower acceptance for low-alcohol
  wine in France could be due to the long wine tradition within the
  French culture.~~

- ~~A significant difference between the conditions was also found for
  'willingness to pay'. Participants were willing to pay more for
  standard wine than for low-alcohol wine. This finding is in line with
  the previous research, suggesting that in wine consumer
  decision-making, price and taste play a bigger role than health
  benefits~~

  of the equipment and the cost associated with its operation~~

- ~~Despite the ability of these techniques to preserve the phenolic
  components, volatile composition, and sensory qualities of wine within
  certain limits of dealcoholization, problems such as changes in color
  and losses of desirable volatile aroma compounds, which subsequently
  affect the sensory quality could occur.~~

~~Among membrane separation techniques, reverse osmosis (RO) is the most
utilized, with the advantage of working at low temperatures of
approximately 8-10° The disadvantage is incremental alcohol reduction,
with a max reduction of 6% ABV) as well the loss of volatile aroma
compounds through the membrane. Reverse Osmosis is batch processed prior
to maturation or blending, passing the wine through a fine porous
membrane permeable to water and alcohol at pressure filtration (up to 4
Mpa), through the difference in molecular weight. Alcohol is removed by
0.7% to 1.5% ABV per pass, thus a 15% wine would take 8 passes to remove
alcohol to 3%.~~

~~The vacuum distillation method is ideal because it can remove alcohol
down to \<0.5% -- \<0.02% ABV. This method involves gently heating the
wine to allow the separation of alcohol and water based on differences
in the boiling point; thanks to the very low pressure obtained in our
equipment, the maximum temperature reached is no more than 48ºC. The
alcohol evaporates and is captured separately from the remaining
dealcoholized wine. This technology combines a vast surface area, low
temperature, and minimal residence time to avoid any thermal damage or
stress to the wine. With experience, this method can be used to capture
most of the volatile aroma compounds that can be added back to the
dealcoholized wine, ensuring a more flavorful, aromatic non-alcoholic
wine that retains more of its wine-like character. Alcohol can be
removed from 15% down to \<0.5% -- \<0.02% ABV in a single pass. The two
most effective and widely used technologies used in this sector are the
SCC (Spinning Cone Column) and packed columns. BevZero offers both
technologies to its customers.~~

~~The SCC is a vertical stainless-steel cylinder composed of alternating
rotating cones that spread the wine out into a thin film, allowing rapid
removal of the alcohol. The most volatile aroma compounds are extracted
from the wine in a quick and gentle first pass, then the alcohol is
removed in a second pass. The aroma components are then blended back
into the wine.~~

~~Packed Columns consist of two or more columns as vertical
stainless-steel cylinders, which are filled with packing material that
provide a huge surface area, making distillation very efficient. This
method is a continuous process and extracts the aromas and the
dealcoholized wine in one single run.~~

~~The high capital costs of both vacuum distillation technologies and
the need for dedicated staff and in-house dealcoholization expertise
make purchasing the equipment viable only for companies dealcoholizing
large volumes; for smaller volumes, the wine can be dealcoholized by an
experienced service provider such as BevZero.~~

- ~~Other than beer, the German wine sector has remained largely
  unaffected by the developments in demand for alcohol beverages. Wine
  and sparkling wine consumption has remained at a constant level of
  around 24 L per capita (including sparkling wine) in recent decades.
  Between 2019 and 2022, however, a slight decline of around one liter
  per capita became apparent~~

- ~~There are two basic ways to remove the alcohol content of wine:
  membrane-based processes and vacuum distillation. The former include
  techniques such as reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, pervaporation, and
  osmotic distillation. A comprehensive overview of the individual
  procedures is provided by Zamora \[11\]. As Schmitt and Christmann
  \[33\] showed, membrane processes can be particularly suitable for
  partial dealcoholization.~~

- ~~However, full dealcoholization is associated with high energy and
  resource consumption, which is why technologies such as reverse
  osmosis are rarely used for this purpose. In Germany, thermal
  processes in the form of vacuum distillation have become the most
  popular method to produce non-alcoholic wine, e.g., by vacuum
  rectification or spinning cone column~~

- ~~the perception in terms of body and fullness of the product differs
  significantly from that of the untreated initial wine. In order to
  balance the perception of acidity, sugar is added to the products. At
  the same time, the addition of sugar is intended to imitate the
  mouthfeel of ethanol in alcoholic wines \[11\]. According to
  legislation of the European Union (Art. 3 (5) Regulation EU 2019/934
  read in conjunction with Annex I Regulation (EU) 1308/2013), only the
  addition of grape must, concentrated grape must, and rectified
  concentrated grape must is permitted, whereas the addition of sucrose
  or sugar substitutes is not.~~

Sometimes the flavors will change, some \[aromatic compounds\] come
through and some don't." Winter agrees: "Alcohol is tough, because it
has flavor, it has weight, it has a burn, it has sweetness, and when you
remove it, you lose all of those things." In the case of Sovi's red
wine, Littauer has found balance in a combination of products. "We've
had to do a lot of blending," she says. "We want to balance tannins and
oak notes and fruit, and we haven't gotten to a place where just a
single wine works perfectly."

~~When you remove alcohol from beer, retaining the flavor is a different
story. "You're going from like five percent or seven percent down to
zero \[and\] it doesn't make that big of a difference," Winter explains.
"With wine, it could be 15 percent alcohol, and that gap is pretty
noticeable."~~

~~Many winemakers turn to additives after dealcoholization to address
that gap. "Thankfully, it's an FDA product, so we now have every
ingredient that's FDA certified at our disposal," Winter says. "We have
to look at those and see what we can add to these products to bring back
mouthfeel and bring back the flavor. We haven't found anything that can
bring back the burn---at least, nothing that is safe to consume."~~

- ~~A report by the World Cancer Research Fund in 2007 stated that a
  decrease in alcohol content from 14.2 to 10% would reduce the risk of
  breast and bowel cancer by 7%~~

- ~~onsumers may perceive low-alcohol beverages as a healthier
  alternative to accompany their healthy diet and lifestyle \[29, 33\].
  In line with this, Meillon etal. \[34\] and Thompson and Thompson
  \[35\] found that people were motivated to drink low-alcohol beverages
  for calorie and weight management~~

- ~~Non-availability of the products, lower quality perceptions, taste
  issues, lack of awareness, lack of alcohol's feel effect and absence
  of a lower alcohol drinking occasion, were described as the main
  barriers to buying reduced alcohol wine~~

- ~~A study by Meillon etal. \[51\], found that a reduction below or
  equal to −4% (resulting in a wine of 9.5%) had no significant impact
  on wine liking, however when the alcohol reduction reached the value
  of −5.5% (resulting in a wine of 7.9%), it was significantly disliked
  by consumers~~

- ~~To circumvent negative consequences of low alcohol labelling on
  perception, a few strategies have been suggested in the literature.
  These include increasing consumer knowledge related to alcohol
  reduction processes and increasing consumer awareness about high
  quality low-alcohol wines with appealing sensory properties. Media
  campaigns and specific awards or recognitions for lower strength wines
  might be helpful to promote consumer awareness of high quality
  low-alcohol wine products.~~

Review sources and pages, years, months

~~Some examples, flesh out production method section need to rewrite -
evaluate what styles might be appropriate, volume required~~

~~What improvements in tech have happened~~

Outline

1.  Candidates need to demonstrate an ability to distil research facts
    down to those that are most relevant to the specifics of the
    questions set, to analyse them and express personal opinions that
    show they have a clear understanding of the topic. It is also
    important at the outset to take careful note of information in the
    Assignment Brief, such as the weighting of the various sections and
    instructions about content, format and presentation because these
    can all have an impact on the final grade achieved.

2.  Of the 100 marks available for the research assignment, 15 are
    allocated to presentation and structure. In awarding these marks,
    examiners consider issues such as the method of approach to the
    Assignment Brief, coherence, flair, fluency, use of examples
    throughout the assignment, diversity of the bibliography, use of
    information obtained via the bibliography, correct referencing of
    the bibliography throughout the assignment, and the fundamentals of
    presentation such as spelling,grammar and legibility

3.  ~~he 'marketing mix' provided a viable approach in this section of
    the question. The best answers were generated by those candidates
    who raised questions and suggested likely answers. For example,
    natural wines currently occupy a small 'niche' in the wine world.
    How much is there in the marketplace? Is it set to grow, or is it
    just a fad? Supplying answers to these and other questions is what
    'evaluation' is about. Some candidates compared natural wine to
    craft beer, commenting that this arguably has a similarly 'grey'
    definition to natural wine, yet it has massively thrived in recent
    years. They queried whether natural wine could learn from the
    success of craft beer. Other valid points for discussion included
    (but were by no means limited to) the following:~~

    a.  ~~• Can natural wine be made in commercial quantities -- do they
        (can they) occupy shelf space at supermarkets?~~

    b.  ~~• Should they remain the products of specialist retailers/wine
        bars and wine focussed restaurants where sommeliers/staff can
        hand sell them~~

    c.  ~~• Often natural wines have very distinctive labels with
        cork/wax closures -- is this good marketing or a gimmick?~~

    d.  ~~• Cost is a factor to consider -- most natural wines by their
        nature are not cheap. Is this a hinderance or a potential to
        make money?~~

4.  The 'Harvard system' is one of the most well- recognised referencing
    systems and the examiners would recommend using this system as there
    are numerous detailed guides on this available online. Your
    references should, however, meet the following basic criteria:

    a.  • For web sources, you should include the full URL which will
        take the reader directly to the relevant page. You should also
        include the date when you last accessed the link.

    b.  • For books and journals or magazines, you should include the
        author's name, the publication and article title and the
        relevant page numbers.

    c.  • For unwritten sources (e.g. people you have interviewed), you
        should include as much detail as possible to enable the examiner
        to follow up as necessary.

5.  Bibliography

    a.  You must include a bibliography as an appendix to your
        assignment and this should be consistent with the style of
        in-text referencing system chosen (e.g. using the Harvard
        System). Your bibliography should contain a list of all the
        works you have referenced, quoted or relied on within the body
        of your assignment

    b.  The works you have consulted should be listed alphabetically by
        author surname and should include the full title, edition,
        publisher and date of publication. Web resources should be cited
        with the full URL and the date when you last accessed the
        relevant page. For example: Woolf, Simon J; Amber Revolution
        \[Interlink Books 2018\] Organisation Internationale de La Vigne
        et du Vin; State of the Vitiviniculture World Market April 2018
        \[http://www.oiv.int/public/medias/5958/oiv-state-of-the-vitiviniculture-world-market-april-2018.pdf
        (last accessed 31/06/19)\] Robinson et al; The Oxford Companion
        to Wine (4th Edition) \[Oxford University Press 2015\]

6.  Footnotes and Appendices

    a.  Footnotes are a useful tool for including author's notes or
        additional information that may otherwise disrupt the flow of
        the main text. Their content does not form part of the permitted
        word count.

    b.  Where more than a sentence of text appears in a footnote the
        examiner will consider whether the point being made should have
        been included in the body of the assignment. If so, it will be
        disregarded by the examiner and you will not gain marks for that
        observation.

    c.  Appendices are acceptable if you wish to include material that
        is unsuitable for the main body of text. Material that is vital
        to your argument should be included in the main body rather than
        as an appendix.
